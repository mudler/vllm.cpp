Title: Measure vllm-tt-plugin gateability on the row's P150 (qwen35 served, tokens emitted)

## Problem

The vllm-tt-plugin oracle record (.agents/oracles/vllm-tt-plugin.md, pin 7250ddfaa, 2026-09-21) is filed with gateable = no: nothing from the plugin has executed in this repository. The oracle-registry checker requires an owing issue named on a gateable=no record; this is it. Owed measurement: install vLLM 0.26.0 (VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=empty) plus the plugin at the pinned HEAD inside a tt-metal environment on the row's P150, serve one registered qwen35 checkpoint, and record tokens emitted. Establishing gateability also unlocks the primary-rank denominators the Tenstorrent rows want: on-device qwen35 graph correctness at bf16 (vs our GGUF-decoded bf16 arm, per-layer like the llama.cpp bisect) and the native ~50 tok/s qwen35 rate measured side by side on the same card. Source: vllm.ai blog 2026-09-07; supported architectures include TTQwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration. NOT established by this measurement: GGUF-decode parity (the plugin serves HF weights; llama.cpp stays the GGUF decode oracle).
