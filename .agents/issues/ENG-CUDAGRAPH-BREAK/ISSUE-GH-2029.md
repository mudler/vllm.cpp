Title: With DFlash2 speculation OFF the engine dies at c=8 in CUDA graph capture: `cudaMalloc: operation not permitted when stream is capturing`. Located statically: `Pool(b).PreGrowForCapture(b, s.demand)` — the #1380 capture pre-grow — sits INSIDE `if (dbuf)` in both Qwen3.5 decode-graph drivers (`qwen3_5.cpp:10885/10907`, `:11439/11461`), and `dbuf = impl_->dbuf || spec_step` is false on the DEFAULT server, where `VT_ASYNC_EXECUTOR` is unset and no step is speculative. So the pre-grow is exactly the "path taken only when speculation is off" the issue names, by its absence. Spec [cudagraph-pregrow-nonspec.md](../specs/cudagraph-pregrow-nonspec.md)
