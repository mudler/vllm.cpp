ID: ISSUE-GH-2036
Title: `DenseAlignFor` (`qwen3_5.cpp:2825-2849`) allocates five blocks and calls `d.b.Synchronize(d.q)` at `:2846` on an `M` miss, and `EnsureCtmp` (`cuda_marlin_dense.cu:74-89`) grows with `cudaMallocAsync` at `:85`, both with no `cudaStreamIsCapturing` refusal — unlike the six sibling shape-keyed caches that have one. Latent today (the cold step visits the same key), found while fixing #2029; owed under `## Owed` in [cudagraph-pregrow-nonspec.md](../specs/cudagraph-pregrow-nonspec.md)
