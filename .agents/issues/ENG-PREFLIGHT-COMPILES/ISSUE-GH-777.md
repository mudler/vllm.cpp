ID: ISSUE-GH-777
Title: Two GPU mutexes: the documented `flock $GPU_LOCK` took a DIFFERENT file from the harness scripts, so following the docs produced an unserialised run — it voided a standalone Marlin series (every absolute downgraded to an upper bound) and `flock` succeeds on the wrong path, so nothing at run time can see it. FIXED: `${GPU_LOCK:-$HOME/gpu.lock}` everywhere, pinned by `tests/scripts/test_gpu_lock_one_truth.py`, spec [`gpu-lock-one-truth.md`](../specs/gpu-lock-one-truth.md)
