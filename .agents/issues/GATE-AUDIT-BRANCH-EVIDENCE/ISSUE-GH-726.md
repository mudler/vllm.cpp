Title: `audit-live-rows --check` calls every in-flight row ABANDONED in CI: the `agent-record` job fetches only `main`, so no `row/*` ref exists and the `IN-FLIGHT` verdict is unreachable — any PR moving a row to `ACTIVE` before its code lands fails deterministically, spec [`gate-audit-branch-evidence.md`](../specs/gate-audit-branch-evidence.md)
