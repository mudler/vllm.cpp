ID: ISSUE-GH-822
Title: Superseded runs accumulate: 32 obsolete queued runs cancelled by hand on 2026-08-14, and `containers.yml` had no concurrency policy at all. The push lane becomes latest-only, a closed pull request supersedes its own run without gating, and the diff-scoped gates base on the last successfully gated commit so cancellation is lossless (spec [`ci-concurrency.md`](../specs/ci-concurrency.md))
