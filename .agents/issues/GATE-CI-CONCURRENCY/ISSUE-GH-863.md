ID: ISSUE-GH-863
Title: The strict trailer walk is diff-scoped but ran in `agent-record`, which carries a cancellable group keyed on `github.ref`; on run 31851003245 it was cancelled and `51e0cb5b1` landed failing it with CI silent. A workflow-level cancel takes group-free jobs too, so the real repair is the self-healing base, not the job move (spec [`ci-concurrency.md`](../specs/ci-concurrency.md))
