ID: ISSUE-GH-873
Title: `main` went RED on six release/registration gates after the #865 `ci.yml` rewrite: `check-release-binary-contract.py` and `check-test-registration.py` credit a checker to CI only through an UNCONDITIONAL job, and #865 gave `agent-record` an `if:`; the closed-PR skip is re-expressed through `needs:` and the byte-exact Windows PR proof schema restored (spec [`ci-concurrency.md`](../specs/ci-concurrency.md))
