ID: ISSUE-GH-861
Title: `PR_BODY` did not remove the `---------` separator: GitHub writes it above the `Co-authored-by:` block it appends, under both settings, so `617d6f452` landed failing the trailer gate with ONE block and one marker. #829 and #850 concluded otherwise from a simulation that omitted it. The fuse now steps over the separator when trailers sit on both sides (spec [`squash-separator.md`](../specs/squash-separator.md))
