ID: ISSUE-GH-829
Title: A squash of a multi-commit PR repeats the trailer block once per commit; the repetition is harmless because `git interpret-trailers --parse` reads only the trailing block, and the real defect is GitHub's `---------` separator falling between the block and the appended `Co-authored-by:`, which orphans it. Fixed by setting `squash_merge_commit_message = PR_BODY` (spec [`squash-trailers.md`](../specs/squash-trailers.md))
