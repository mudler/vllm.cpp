ID: ISSUE-GH-856
Title: `pr-size` aborts on every pull request: `.agents/issue-index.md` was never added to `PROJECT_RECORD_FILES` when #840 created it, and classification is a hard error by design, so every PR appending an index row fails the gate (spec [`squash-trailers.md`](../specs/squash-trailers.md))
