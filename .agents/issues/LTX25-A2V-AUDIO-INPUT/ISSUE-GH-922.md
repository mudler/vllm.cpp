ID: ISSUE-GH-922
Title: LTX-2.5 audio-to-video (`A2VidPipelineTwoStage`, `a2vid_two_stage.py:53,143`) is absent: `vllm_video_params` carries no field or extra that accepts a driving waveform and `ltx2-gen` has no `--audio-path`, so nothing turns a file on disk into the audio latent the DiT's audio stream consumes. Distinct from reference-audio conditioning, which is correctly refused by name at `ltx2_video.cpp:1348-1355 @ 5a0ffe9e`; the two share one blocking dependency, the audio VAE ENCODER load path (`ltx2_loader.cpp:1295-1300` materializes `audio_vae.decoder.` only). The analysis half is already ported and unreached — `Ltx2AudioEncoderForward` (`ltx2_audio_vae.cpp:1114`), `Ltx2WaveformToLogMel` (`:1019`), `Ltx2SlaneyMelFilterbank` (`:970`) — and the engine applies ONE `phase.noise_scale` to both streams (`ltx2_video.cpp:1708-1712 @ 5a0ffe9e`) where upstream's `ModalitySpec` carries `noise_scale` and `frozen` per modality (`utils/types.py:99-112`).
