ID: ISSUE-GH-1470
Title: **`test_ltx2_video` false-redded once on `main` under load and the failing case's identity was never captured.** The prediction it records (F12 of #1441's fifth review) was that a coverage floor whose per-boundary sampling cost is fixed while the leaf shrinks is a false-RED risk and never a false pass. Measured by `LTX25-PHASE-RESIDUE`: the prediction is right about the polarity and WRONG about the term. The `denoise` coverage miss is not sampling cost, it is the sampler's post-process and Euler step, which no anchor wrapped and which scale with the latent -- 49 us per step at nine frames against 343 us at 81, in ONE run of one binary, and instrument cost does not move 7x with the latent. **STILL OPEN, and the correction above is the whole of what this row establishes.** The row's branch anchored that work as `denoise.update` and [#1556](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1556) is CLOSED rather than merged, so nothing anchors it on `main` today; the anchor is owed under [#1668](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1668). An earlier draft of this row said the issue was closed by anchoring, which was true of the branch and never of the tree. Spec [`ltx25-phase-residue.md`](../specs/ltx25-phase-residue.md)
