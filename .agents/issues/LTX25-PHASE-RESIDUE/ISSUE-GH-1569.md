ID: ISSUE-GH-1569
Title: `PhaseLog::WriteJson`'s clock ordering is ungated and its own mutation stays GREEN 10 of 10 -- `wall 0.0608987s, unaccounted 0.000534223s, table charge 0.000301655s` -- because the copy and sort of a three-record table are nanoseconds. The claim was WITHDRAWN from the source by `LTX25-PHASE-RESIDUE` rather than defended, which is the reason this is a filed gap and not a passing test. Gating it needs a table with enough records for the sort to be measurable and a `WriteJson` with nothing between it and the last `Close`.
