ID: ISSUE-GH-339
Title: 27B c1: every fp8 input projection asks for an f32 output, selecting the slower nvjet template family where vLLM emits bf16 (48 f32-out projections 18.51 ms vs 48 bf16-out 7.05 ms). The merged GDN `in_proj` arm is built DEFAULT OFF as `VT_GDN_FP8_IN_BF16`, spec [`perf-fp8-alpha-fold.md`](../specs/perf-fp8-alpha-fold.md) §Attempt 4 — UNMEASURED: no committed gate loads the fp8 tower (`row/GATE-27B-FP8-TOWER-GOLDEN` builds that arm)
