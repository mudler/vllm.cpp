Title: `AlphaVecBf16TakesTwoLaunch` bounded a COUNT of ulp mismatches instead of their MAGNITUDE, and was RED on its first CUDA run at ~26% — the double-rounding population the bf16-D lever produces by construction. Replaced by a max-ulp bound (`<= 1`, and `<= 0` at a pow2 alpha), measured 0/1-ulp only over 2.17M words on GB10, spec [`perf-fp8-alpha-fold.md`](../specs/perf-fp8-alpha-fold.md) §The bf16-vs-f32 divergence is DOUBLE ROUNDING
