Title: The issue intake table sits inside `roadmap_v1.md`, which 51 of the last 60 commits touch, and two branches appending a row conflict under the default merge and merge cleanly under `merge=union`; a `.gitattributes` entry binds a path and never a section, so the table moves to `.agents/issue-index.md` and becomes append-only, and ownership becomes a network-free gate because 33 of the 185 rows name no owning row (spec [`issue-intake.md`](../specs/issue-intake.md))
