ID: ISSUE-GH-516
Title: `vllm::Pool()`'s free list is keyed by size class with NO DEVICE in the key, so a `cudaMalloc` block reaches a CPU `DBuf` (SIGSEGV) and a host block reaches a CUDA forward (uniform `0x7fff0000` NaN); spec [`pool-device-key.md`](../specs/pool-device-key.md), lands through `row/MODEL-DIFFUSION-LTX25`
