Title: **CUDA has no keep-quant kernel for IQ2_XS or IQ4_XS, so the GLM-5.3-Flash artifact FITS `dgx:gpu0` and does not RUN there — the expert GEMM falls back to the CPU, and the fused seam throws.** Found reviewing [#2256](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/pull/2256), which lands the two CPU keep-quant `vec_dot` kernels and thereby flips the artifact's 82 IQ2_XS and 3 IQ4_XS tensors from `kExpandBf16` to `kKeepQuant`, taking resident cost 426.72 -> 101.14 GiB. `IsCudaKeepQuantSupported` admits ten Q8_K-family encodings (IQ2_XXS, IQ3_XXS, Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, IQ2_S, IQ1_S, IQ1_XXXS) and neither of these two, while `DeviceKeepQuantSupported` returns `true` for CUDA on its `default:` arm regardless, on the recorded ground that CUDA falls back to the CPU kernel for anything it lacks. So `MatmulBTQuantGroupedKernelCuda` round-trips every grouped expert GEMM to the host cores behind a full `cudaStreamSynchronize`, and `MoeGateUpSwiGLUGroupedCuda` THROWS `gate/up must be the SAME CUDA keep-quant dtype` because `MergedGemm` selects the fused op on device registration alone with no dtype predicate. NOT reachable today — `glm5_next_moe.cpp` is W5's host reference and `laguna.cpp` is the only model on the fused seam — so #2256 breaks nothing; it becomes live when AGENTS.md's `vt::MergedGemmGroup` routing lands in W5b ([#2241](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2241)) / W5c ([#2242](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2242)), and a 101 GiB-resident model then throws at first forward. Three options in the issue: port the two CUDA kernels, keep expanding these two on CUDA (honest, but the artifact stops fitting), or refuse by name at load instead of throwing with the model resident.
