ID: ISSUE-GH-1963
Title: At ctx=32768 `--max-num-seqs 32` our engine consumes ~108 GB during load and never serves; vLLM and SGLang both serve there. Root cause found and fixed by `FIX-KV-GROUP-LAYER-COUNT` ([spec](../specs/kv-group-layer-count.md)): thirty-three of thirty-four registries publish ONE placeholder name per KV group, `KVBytesPerBlock` reads `layer_names.size()` as the layer count, and `ResolveNumBlocks` arm 2 therefore divides an absolute `--kv-cache-memory` budget by ONE layer's page while the runner allocates one buffer per layer — measured 8.5 GiB allocated for a 1 GiB budget on the 27B
