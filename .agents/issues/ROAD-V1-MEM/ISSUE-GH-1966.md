ID: ISSUE-GH-1966
Title: The #371 recurrent-state OOM guard is 48x under and passes a config that allocates 43.4 GiB, because `recurrent_state_bytes` counts placeholder layer names. Same root defect as [#1963](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1963), different code path; both fixed by `FIX-KV-GROUP-LAYER-COUNT` ([spec](../specs/kv-group-layer-count.md))
