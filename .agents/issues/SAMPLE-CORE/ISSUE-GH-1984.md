ID: ISSUE-GH-1984
Title: `RandomSampleKernel` is launched `<<<n, 1>>>` and scans a 248,320-wide vocab on one thread per row, computing two `SplitMix64` rounds and an f64 `log` per element. Eleven lines above it the same file records that a single-block single-thread scan of a ~151k vocab cost ~7.5 ms/token, which is why greedy argmax was rewritten into `ArgmaxPartialKernel`/`ArgmaxFinalKernel`; the Gumbel draw never got that treatment. Upstream is whole-tensor (`vllm/v1/sample/ops/topk_topp_sampler.py::sample_with_exponential_noise`), so this is a mirror obligation. Reached by every non-greedy row through `ModelRunner::execute_model` -> `Sampler::forward` -> `vt::RandomSample`.
