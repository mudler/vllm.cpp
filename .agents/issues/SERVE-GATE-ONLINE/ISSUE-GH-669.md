ID: ISSUE-GH-669
Title: Chunked prefill: our TTFT is budget-invariant because 1x4096 and 2x2048 are the same total work, NOT because the budget is ignored — composition now pinned, so no timing gate can re-litigate it; the pin's own 4096-token forward is the outlier (spec [`perf-chunked-prefill-budget-2026-08-13.md`](../specs/perf-chunked-prefill-budget-2026-08-13.md))
