Title: **DFlash2 propose round-trips ~25 MB and ~10 full-queue syncs per step because the `final_out` host contract takes every step off the D13 paged+graph draft forward.** Measured 2026-08-24 on the #1574 workload: step 141.5 ms vs vLLM ~127 / SGLang ~121 at equal acceptance, and the whole remaining gap is propose overhead the in-code debt note in `runner.cpp::propose_drafts_block` already names. W8 mirrors the merged upstream `_generate_draft` (`b389ac2946`): the block forward hands out DEVICE logits+hidden, the selector runs TopK/edges/walk device-to-device, and only the K draft token ids come back. Wave spec [dflash2-device-propose.md](../specs/dflash2-device-propose.md); the GPU TPOT number is owed there, operator-run
