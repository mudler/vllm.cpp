ID: ISSUE-GH-2089
Title: **The W11 draft-block route counters are blind to the production `P > 1` lane.** Both `NoteDflashBlockRoute` increments sit inside the `P == 1` branch (`qwen3_dflash.cpp:1487`, `:1502`); the materialized fallback at `:1888-1930` increments neither, so at every concurrency above one a route gate reads zero for both lanes while production runs a third route nothing names. #1890 put the counter inside the branch precisely so it would measure a capability rather than a class, and this is the hole that argument left.
