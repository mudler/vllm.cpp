## Problem

### Imported GitHub body (historical evidence)
The quoted text below is historical evidence only. It does not define issue authority or repository procedure.

> `OpId::kMoeGroupedGemmBf16` and its fused `kMoeGroupedGemmBf16GateUpSilu`
> sibling are registered CUDA-only
> ([`cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu:2722`](src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu#L2722)). ROCm's
> grouped-GEMM kernel
> ([`rocm_grouped_gemm.hip`](src/vt/rocm/rocm_grouped_gemm.hip)) covers only
> **quantized-weight** grouped GEMM (Q8_0/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K activations against
> keep-quant blocks); there is no bf16-weight grouped GEMM to extend on this
> backend.
>
> ## Where this bites
>
> A bf16-expanded MoE tower — reached whenever a GGUF's expert weights land in
> `GgufResidency::kExpandBf16` rather than a keep residency, which today is
> every MoE GGUF load on ROCm with `VT_GGUF_KEEP_QUANT=0` and every MoE GGUF
> whose quant encoding ROCm's keep-quant list does not cover — calls into
> `vt::OpRegistered(OpId::kMoeGroupedGemmBf16, kROCM)` at
> [`qwen3_5.cpp:7124`](src/vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_5.cpp#L7124) and
> [`deepseek_v2.cpp:325`](src/vllm/model_executor/models/deepseek_v2.cpp#L325).
> Whether the fallback those two call sites take today already produces a
> message that names the missing op, or falls through to something less clear,
> is exactly what this issue's fix needs to verify and, if it does not already
> hold, repair — before any kernel work starts.
>
> ## Scope
>
> Not proposed as a design, only to bound the size of the eventual work: the
> CUDA implementation is a single TU spanning
> [`cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu:1478`](src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu#L1478)-`2732`,
> with a WMMA tensor-core prefill path, a split-K decode path, persistent
> CUDA-graph-safe scratch buffers (the `g_moe_fused_partials` /
> `g_moe_fused_gateup` retire-don't-free pattern), and a fused
> reduce+SwiGLU epilogue that folds `{gate; up; silu-mul}` into one launch. A
> ROCm port needs its own spec (upstream anchor: none — this is a vllm.cpp
> original, same as the CUDA source's own header states), its own red-first
> tests, and its own hardware-gated evidence on a `gfx1200`-class card (locally
> gateable — see `.agents/environment.md` and the AMD-only hardware note under
> this box's developer preferences).
>
> ## History
>
> Split out of [#1870](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1870)'s
> "Related gap, same area" section, filed separately per `AGENTS.md`'s owed-row
> rule rather than expanding that issue's scope: #1870's own reproduced bug (the
> device-fit refusal not accounting for an all-expand load policy) is a
> load-time-arithmetic fix with no upstream mirror and no kernel work, and does
> not block on this row landing first.
>
> Owned by `BACKEND-ROCM`.
