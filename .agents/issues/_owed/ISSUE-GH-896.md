ID: ISSUE-GH-896
Title: No gate refuses a new unchecked `static_cast<...LoadedModel&>` in a registry entry point. The #847 sweep decided the checker is warranted — the class is exactly grep-able, unlike the unaligned-read class in #627, and it regrows the moment a new model port copies its neighbour — and deliberately did not bundle a repository-wide refusal gate into a 30-file mechanical sweep. Listed under `## Owed` in [`registry-downcast-sweep.md`](../specs/registry-downcast-sweep.md) §6
