Title: The res_2s DENOISING LOOP (`ltx-pipelines utils/samplers.py:206-447` @ `fd4ded7f2`) is unported, so `TI2VidTwoStagesHQPipeline` cannot be served. What exists is one substep's SDE arithmetic: `Ltx2Res2sSdeCoeff`/`Ltx2Res2sStep` (`ltx2_pipeline.cpp:307-360 @ 5a0ffe9e3`, the two functions in full) mirror `Res2sDiffusionStep` (`diffusion_steps.py:118-190`) and are gated. Absent are the `phi`/`get_res2s_coefficients` exponential integrator (`utils/res2s.py:4-62`), the SECOND transformer evaluation per step at `sub_sigma = sqrt(sigma * sigma_next)` (`samplers.py:315` and `samplers.py:380-386`, spelt out because a bare `:NN` after a res2s.py citation reads as res2s.py) against our once-per-step loop (`ltx2_video.cpp:1735 @ 5a0ffe9e3`, with its single forward at `ltx2_video.cpp:1813-1817 @ 5a0ffe9e3`), the bong anchor refinement (`samplers.py:357-364`), and any `Ltx2StepperKind` enumerator to select it. The sampler IS the HQ variant, so this arm must refuse by name rather than substitute Euler and render something plausible that is quietly not HQ.
