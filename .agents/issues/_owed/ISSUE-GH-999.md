ID: ISSUE-GH-999
Title: `scripts/check-commit-style.py` `validate_range` still raises `range base must be an ancestor of range head`, so the merge-base repair `GATE-FORK-ANCESTRY` (#773) applied to `check-commit-trailers.py` never reached it: the checker aborts before reading a commit on any branch cut before the last merge of `main`. Found auditing the guards for #998, and it is why that row reports a SKIP rather than dropping the guard and letting both checkers run.
