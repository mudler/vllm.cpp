# CUDA-architecture additivity — implementation spike

Status: **IMPLEMENTED — framework seams (W1-W6); the first SAME-FAMILY arch through
them (W8: `sm_120a`, BUILD-supported, runtime HW-blocked); and the first CROSS-FAMILY
arch (W9: `sm_90a` Hopper, single-arch PORTABLE-KERNELS-ONLY build-supported, runtime
HW-blocked, no fast paths)**.
Owners: `CLAIM-CUDA-ARCH-ADDITIVITY` (the seams), `CLAIM-CUDA-SM120-BRINGUP` (W8),
`CLAIM-CUDA-SM090-BRINGUP` (W9).
Rows: **`BACKEND-CUDA-ARCH-ADDITIVITY`** (new, the seam row), advancing
`BACKEND-CUDA-SM120` / `BACKEND-CUDA-SM121` / `BACKEND-CUDA-COMP-FP4` /
`BACKEND-CUDA-COMP-MARLIN` / `BACKEND-CUDA-COMP-SCALEDMM-C3X` / `BACKEND-CUDA-COMP-FA`.
Roadmap wiring: **`ROAD-V1-D1`** (NVIDIA target fan-out).

Pins: vLLM `/home/mudler/_git/vllm` @ `e24d1b24`; local base `c56ab28`.

This spec executes the four SEAM-GAPS the completed audit already named in
[breadth-sweep-plan.md](breadth-sweep-plan.md) §A.2. It does **not** re-audit and
it does **not** bring up any architecture. Its whole purpose is that adding a
CUDA architecture vLLM supports becomes a **table-row edit plus a tactic
registration**, instead of a hunt through four CMake regexes and three host
launchers.

**What this change is NOT.** It does not make any untested architecture
supported. In the audit's own words, cross-family bring-up "is a kernel
campaign, not an additive drop-in" (§A.4); the W1-W6 body of this spec builds the
seams that campaign will plug into, and nothing more.

**W8 AMENDS ONE SENTENCE OF THAT, and only one.** `BACKEND-CUDA-SM120` has moved
off `INVENTORIED` — but to **BUILD-supported**, not to runtime support. sm_120a
compiles, emits real SASS, and resolves every feature; it has never executed a
gate model here and cannot until someone owns the hardware. Everything else above
stands. See §W8 in the work breakdown.

### Scope

**In.** The four §A.2 seam-gaps, in dependency order:

| Gap | Defect | Fix landed here |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | Four CMake guards hardcode `MATCHES "12[01]a"` over the WHOLE arch list | per-arch FEATURE TABLE + vLLM's loose-intersection resolution |
| #4 | Kernel layer cannot see the capability source of truth | one cached device-capability probe, threaded to the kernel layer and carried by the backend |
| #2 | Host launchers take no capability and have no SM selector | a type-erased tactic registry; the launcher selects, tactics register |
| #3 | `cuda_paged_attn.cu` hardcodes the GB10 100 KiB opt-in smem ceiling | the queried `cudaDevAttrMaxSharedMemoryPerBlockOptin`, cached |

**Dispatch behavior.** Exactly ONE tactic is registered: the existing
`sm_12x` native block-scaled fp4xfp4 path. On GB10 the new selector reduces to
the old `#if VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A && NativeFp4MmaEnabled()` test — same kernel, same
grid, same stream. This change is **behavior-preserving by construction**; it is
structural, not a perf or numerics change.

**Out.** Hopper `wgmma` / `sm_100` `tcgen05` kernel bodies (a separate,
hardware-blocked campaign); per-source `-gencode` narrowing (see Risks); the
`d == 256` tensor-core shape gate in `cuda_paged_attn.cu:2529`, deliberately left
alone because generalizing it is a numerics change on the gate models' hot path
and this change may not touch numerics; the model/quantization sweep
(Deliverable B of the breadth-sweep plan).

### Upstream chain

Every piece is grounded in a pinned upstream source, per the ground-every-impl rule.

| Ours | Ported FROM | What was taken |
|---|---|---|
| `cmake/CudaArchFeatures.cmake` `cuda_archs_loose_intersection()` | `/home/mudler/_git/vllm/cmake/utils.cmake:376-485` | 1:1 port, comments included: `+PTX` handling, `a`/`f` suffix cross-matching, same-major SASS fallback, symmetric TGT-suffix preservation |
| the per-feature `<F>_ARCHS` + `if(<F>_ARCHS)` idiom | `/home/mudler/_git/vllm/CMakeLists.txt:949-953,963` (`FP4_SM120_ARCHS`), `:775-787` (sm120 `SCALED_MM_ARCHS`), `:556-558` (`MARLIN_ARCHS`), `:918-926` (`CUTLASS_MOE_DATA_ARCHS`) | vLLM asks each feature which of the requested archs support it, then gates on the non-empty result — never a regex over the whole list |
| `src/vt/cuda/cuda_device_caps.h` | `vllm/platforms/cuda.py::CudaPlatform.get_device_capability` @ `e24d1b24`, mirrored locally at `src/vllm/platforms/cuda.cpp:88-91` | one cached `(major, minor)` probe as the single source of truth, plus the device properties (`maxSharedMemoryPerBlockOptin`, `multiProcessorCount`) torch caches alongside it |
| `src/vt/cuda/cuda_arch_tactics.h` | FlashInfer's per-arch tactic registry + runtime selection, `flashinfer/gemm/fp4_gemm_cutlass_template_sm120.h:187-220` (the 32 SM12 tactics already mirrored in `src/vt/cuda/nvfp4_tactic_ids.h`); vLLM's runtime capability gate `vllm/platforms/cuda.py:154-166` → `src/vllm/platforms/cuda.cpp:64-71` | kernel identity is DATA selected at runtime from device properties, not a compile-time `#if` |
| `include/vt/backend.h` `DeviceCapabilityMajor/Minor()` | `vllm/platforms/interface.py` `Platform.get_device_capability` | one cached probe exposed to everything downstream |

**Runtime trace plan.** Dispatch here is dynamic, so source reading is not
sufficient evidence. The tactic registry carries its own counters
(`ArchTacticStats`) and a `VT_ARCH_TACTIC_STATS=1` announcement; the gate asserts
on those counters rather than inferring from a passing test. See Gates.

### Our baseline

| Anchor | State before |
|---|---|
| `CMakeLists.txt:71,88,97,137` | four literal `MATCHES "12[01]a"` guards, evaluated over the whole arch string |
| `src/vt/cuda/cuda_backend.cu:255-273` | probed `cudaDevAttrPageableMemoryAccess` / `cudaDevAttrIntegrated` only; **no SM state at all** |
| `src/vllm/platforms/cuda.cpp:88-91` | authoritative `(major, minor)`, invisible below `vt::` |
| `src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu` `LaunchFp4Fp4` | no capability argument; `#if VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A` straight into sm120a-only `mma.sync kind::mxf4nvf4` PTX |
| `src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_fp8_cutlass.cu:164` | `ArchTag = cutlass::arch::Sm120` baked |
| `src/vt/cuda/cuda_flash_attn_fa2.cu:428` | "all instantiations compiled for sm_121a" |
| `cuda_paged_attn.cu:870,2401` | the 100 KiB opt-in ceiling as a COMMENT assumption; nothing checked it |
| `cuda_paged_attn.cu` × 7 sites | `if (shmem > 48u*1024u) Check(cudaFuncSetAttribute(...))` — an over-budget tile failed opaquely inside the driver |

**Honest gaps that remain after this change** are listed under Risks/decisions.

**Correction to the audit (§A.2 item 1), measured not assumed.** The audit states
that adding `90a` to the arch list "silently disables fp4/fp8-cutlass/Marlin for
*all* archs". That specific claim is **FALSE** and was disproven before
implementing: `if(A MATCHES "12[01]a")` is a SUBSTRING search, so
`A = "90a;121a"` still matches and the features stayed enabled. The real defects
of the old guards, all reproduced by `cmake -P` over the literal expression, are:

1. **No per-arch resolution and no report.** The guard answers "does the list
   contain something spelled like sm_12xa?", not "which archs support this?" — a
   fat build enabled every feature globally, for architectures that cannot run
   them, and printed nothing you could audit.
2. **Silent capability drop on legitimate spellings.** `"121"` (base target) and
   `"12.1a"` (vLLM's own gencode spelling) both FAIL the regex and silently
   disable fp4 + cutlass-nvfp4 + cutlass-fp8 + Marlin for the entire build, with
   no diagnostic. This is the real silent regression; the audit attributed it to
   the wrong trigger.
3. **Nothing enforced that the arch-specific `a` target was requested** for the
   feature that requires it.
4. **No place to declare arch support**, so adding an architecture meant editing
   four regexes — the forward-looking problem this row exists to fix.

The fix addresses all four; the honest evidence is reported as such, not as a
confirmation of the audit's wording.

### Port map

| Upstream / origin | Local file | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `vllm/cmake/utils.cmake:376-485` | `cmake/CudaArchFeatures.cmake` (new) | 1:1 port + `vt_cuda_archs_normalize`/`_denormalize` bridging CMake's `121a` form to vLLM's `12.1a` gencode form, + `VT_CUDA_FEATURE_TABLE`, + `vt_cuda_feature_archs`, + `vt_cuda_report_feature` |
| `vllm/CMakeLists.txt` per-feature intersections | `CMakeLists.txt:64-98` (new block) | resolves and REPORTS `fp4-mma`, `cutlass-nvfp4`, `cutlass-fp8`, `marlin-nvfp4`, `fa2`; the four regexes are gone |
| — | `src/vt/cuda/cuda_device_caps.h` (new) | `DeviceCaps` + `GetDeviceCaps()` + `DynamicSmemFits()`; CUDA-header-free so tests and CPU TUs can include it |
| — | `src/vt/cuda/cuda_arch_tactics.h` (new) | `TacticFamily`, `ArchTactic`, `Nvfp4Fp4MmaArgs`, `RegisterArchTactic`, `SelectArchTactic`, `ArchTacticStats` |
| — | `src/vt/cuda/cuda_arch_tactics.cu` (new) | the cached probe + the registry; a new arch never edits this file |
| — | `include/vt/backend.h` | `DeviceCapabilityMajor/Minor()` virtuals, default `{0,0}` (CPU) |
| — | `src/vt/cuda/cuda_backend.cu` | registrar now uses the ONE shared probe and the backend CARRIES the capability |
| — | `src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu` | `LaunchFp4Fp4` takes `const DeviceCaps&` and dispatches through the registry; the sm_12x tactic + its registrar live next to the kernel body |
| — | `src/vt/cuda/cuda_paged_attn.cu` | `SetDynamicSmemOptIn()` replaces 7 open-coded opt-in blocks; comment assumptions replaced by the queried attribute |

**Deviations from upstream, recorded.**
1. `vt_cuda_feature_archs` post-filters the loose intersection to archs literally
   present in the requested target list. vLLM can be cross-suffix lenient because
   it emits per-source `-gencode` itself; we pass the list straight to
   `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`, and for the fp4 rows the `a` suffix is
   load-bearing (`mma.sync kind::mxf4nvf4` is rejected on base `sm_121`). Without
   the filter, `-DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=121` would define
   `VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A` for a build that cannot emit the instruction — a behavior
   change vs the old guard, and the wrong one.
2. The FEATURE TABLE cells list architectures **we have a built and validated
   kernel body for**, not vLLM's full supported set. Each row's comment records
   vLLM's superset so widening a cell is mechanical once the tactic lands. In
   particular `marlin-nvfp4` does NOT claim vLLM's `8.0+PTX` leg: our vendored
   slice is the bf16 NVFP4 instantiation only and has never been built or run
   outside `sm_12x`. A green fatbinary link is not execution evidence.

### Tests to port

vLLM's arch-selection logic lives in CMake and in `vllm/platforms/cuda.py`;
upstream has no unit test module for either (it is validated by its build matrix
and by `tests/kernels/` skipping on capability). The equivalent local coverage:

| Case | Local tier | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| CMake feature resolution across single-arch, multi-arch, unsupported-arch and base-suffix target lists | configure-tier, run as the GAP #1 gate | `cmake/CudaArchFeaturesTest.cmake` (W8) — `cmake -P`, no CUDA toolkit and no GPU needed, 35 hard expectations over `121a` / `120a` / `120a;121a` / base `120`,`121` / `90a;121a` / `80`; wired into CI as the `cuda-arch-features` job. Mutant-checked: narrowing the `fp4-mma` row to `12.1a` fails it (exit 1, 2 mismatches). Plus the real `cmake -S . -B` configures in Gates |
| backend carries the driver-reported capability | doctest | `tests/vt/test_cuda_backend.cpp` — "CUDA backend reports the device compute capability" |
| capability probe is real; registry is registered, consulted, and SELECTS | doctest | `tests/vt/test_ops_nvfp4_fp4.cpp` — "CUDA arch tactic registry is exercised by the fp4xfp4 launcher" |
| the smem opt-in ceiling is the queried attribute | exercised by every WMMA path in | `tests/vt/test_ops_paged_attn.cpp` |
| behavior preservation on the gate models | parity | `tests/parity/test_qwen27_paged_engine.cpp`, `test_qwen36_paged_engine.cpp`, `test_qwen3coder_paged_engine.cpp` |

No test is checked in SKIPPED by this change.

### Gates

| **W8 sm_120a evidence** | (a) `cmake -P cmake/CudaArchFeaturesTest.cmake` — 35/35 expectations, no CUDA toolkit and no GPU; (b) configure `120a` and `120a;121a` showing all five features `ENABLED for [120a]` with no missing-tactic warning; (c) fat `"120a;121a"` build to 100%, `-Werror` **0 warnings** (`FAT_BUILD_EXIT=0`) AND single-arch `"120a"` build to 100%, `-Werror` **0 warnings** (`BUILD_C_EXIT=0`) — the configuration a 5070 owner would actually use; (d) `cuobjdump -lelf libvllm.a` showing **38 `sm_120a` + 38 `sm_121a`** cubins on the fat build and **38 `sm_120a` alone** on the single-arch build, the fp4-MMA TU among them; (e) the whole GB10 regression set re-run ON the fat binary at production flags, each STANDALONE: 27B 235/235, 35B 315/315, Coder 138/138, Qwen3-dense 664/664, OPT 36/36, DeepSeek-V2 223/223 — ALL UNCHANGED; goldens md5 `2965ef5772b556d3f3f86fedf4221b2f` before AND after |
| **seam-exercised evidence** | the registry counters must MOVE — a passing gate is not proof a new path ran (the W7 decode graph: graph-ON and graph-OFF logs were byte-identical until a stats counter proved capture). `VT_ARCH_TACTIC_STATS=1` prints the selected tactic; the doctest asserts `fallbacks` advances on the production default and `selections` advances with `last_selected == "nvfp4-fp4-mma/sm12x"` under `VT_NVFP4_FP4_NATIVE=1` |

**Performance.** `benchmark_binding=false`. This change adds no kernel and
changes no numerics; it is not a speed claim and takes no speed credit. The
per-launch cost added to `LaunchFp4Fp4` is one cached-struct read plus a
predicate over an 8-entry table, off the gate models' default path entirely
(no tactic supports the device unless `VT_NVFP4_FP4_NATIVE=1`).

Requires target-level `CUDA_ARCHITECTURES OFF` + manual per-TU gencode across every CUDA target. Buys nothing runtime until a cross-family tactic body exists, and it re-codegens the arch we DO run (GB10) so it must be proven byte-identical. **W9 measured that the fat build is the ONLY thing that needs it** — a single-arch cross-family build does not. | `cmake/CudaArchFeatures.cmake`, every `target_sources` CUDA block | NOT STARTED |

### W9 — sm_90a (Hopper), measured

**What "copy sm_90a from vLLM" actually requires — determined, not assumed.** vLLM's
sm_90a support is its widest non-Blackwell path (FA3 Hopper, CUTLASS scaled-mm C3x
`ArchTag=Sm90`, Machete, DeepGEMM, CUTLASS MoE) — every one a **Hopper wgmma / TMA
kernel body we do not have**. Our fast-path kernels are all sm_12x: the native fp4
`mma.sync kind::mxf4nvf4` PTX, `ArchTag=Sm120` for CUTLASS FP8, the Marlin bf16-NVFP4
slice built for sm_12x only, and the vendored FA-2 compiled for sm_12x only. So per
FEATURE-TABLE deviation #2 (a cell lists only archs with a BUILT+VALIDATED body), all
five fast-path cells correctly stay EMPTY for `90a`. **Copying vLLM's 90a fast paths is
a Hopper kernel campaign, untestable here — NOT a config or table edit.** What IS
mechanical and landed: the single-arch portable-kernel build.

**Measured on dgx (nvcc 13.0, `~/work/sm90a`, base `4884d03`+W9):**
- `-DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=90a` resolves fp4-mma / cutlass-nvfp4 / cutlass-fp8 /
  marlin-nvfp4 / fa2 all **DISABLED** ("no requested arch in [90a] provides it") — the
  honest portable-only state.
- **The single-arch `90a` build was BLOCKED before W9** by three `-Werror` `#177-D
  "declared but never referenced"` errors in `cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu`: `FusedFp4VectorEnabled`
  and `PointerAligned` (used only under `#if defined(VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A)`), and the
  `__device__ GetNib` (used only by the `MatmulNvfp4Fp4Native` template, which is
  instantiated only under `VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A`). This is a mechanical guard gap, NOT a
  hardware limit — the sm12x native path is compiled-out on `90a`, so its private helpers
  must be too. **W9 gates all three on `VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A`** (GetNib additionally keeps
  its `__CUDA_ARCH_SPECIFIC__` guard). On GB10 (`121a`, the define is on) the code is
  compiled EXACTLY as before — byte-identical.
- **After W9 the single-arch `90a` build is CLEAN**: `BUILD_90A_EXIT=0`, `-Werror`
  **0 warnings**, and `cuobjdump -lelf libvllm.a` shows **16 TUs carrying real `sm_90a`
  cubins and nothing else** (the 22 fast-path TUs — cutlass/marlin/fa2/fp4-tactics — are
  correctly ABSENT, vs 38 for a full `121a` build).
- **The cross-family FAT build `"90a;121a"` still does NOT compile**, and W9 did not
  change that: `VT_FP4_MMA_SM120A` is defined (121a provides fp4-mma) and the sources are
  gencode'd for the WHOLE list, so `ptxas` rejects the sm12x fp4 PTX for `compute_90a` —
  `Feature '.kind::mxf4nvf4' not supported on .target 'sm_90a'`, `Instruction 'cvt with
  .e2m1x2' not supported`, `Feature '256 bit wide load/store' requires .target sm_100 or
  higher`. This is the fundamental gencode blocker; per-source `-gencode` narrowing is the
  named next row **W7**. (Note it is a DIFFERENT failure from the single-arch one W9 fixed.)

**What is PROVEN for sm_90a:** configure-time feature resolution (all five fast paths
DISABLED — portable-only), a clean `-Werror` single-arch compile, real `sm_90a` SASS in
16 TUs, and the runtime SM-dispatch seam being cross-family-ready (the sole registered
tactic declines a synthetic Hopper `DeviceCaps{sm_major=9}` → portable fallback, asserted
in `test_ops_nvfp4_fp4.cpp` with no GPU).

**What is NOT proven:** any sm_90 execution of anything. No Hopper board exists here. The
portable CUDA kernels have never RUN on sm_90 hardware; a green single-arch link is not
execution evidence and this row does not treat it as such. There are also no Hopper fast
paths at all (fp4/cutlass/marlin/FA2 absent), so even a Hopper owner running this build
gets the portable-kernel path only, not vLLM-competitive throughput.

**What a Hopper (H100/H200) owner must do to validate it:**
1. `cmake -S . -B build -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=90a -DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=OFF`
   (plus `-DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_DIR=<cutlass >=4.5.0>`), then build. Expect the five fast
   paths DISABLED and 0 warnings.
2. Run the unit tier — `test_cuda_backend`, `test_ops_paged_attn`, `test_ops_moe_grouped`
   (the portable WMMA/grouped paths) — and report pass/fail; these have never executed on
   sm_90 silicon.
3. Run a gate model end to end against its golden and report token counts. Only this would
   move `BACKEND-CUDA-SM090` past a build-supported claim.
4. A Hopper-competitive path needs the fp4/CUTLASS/Marlin/FA tactic BODIES ported for
   `sm_90a` (wgmma/TMA) and their FEATURE-TABLE cells widened — the kernel campaign, W7's
   sibling, out of scope here.

### W8 — sm_120a, measured

The audit's §A.3 template predicted a same-family target would be "zero
kernel/model edits". **Measured, that prediction holds, and the arch needed ZERO
edits to the feature table or to any kernel** — the `12.0a` cells were already
written into `VT_CUDA_FEATURE_TABLE` when W1 landed, so `sm_120a` was already
resolvable; what was missing was the evidence, the Triton-AOT answer, and the
record. All three land here.

**The heterogeneous-fat-build obstacle (Risks #1) is FAMILY-SCOPED, and the
same-family case does NOT hit it.** `"120a;121a"` configures, compiles and links
`-Werror` clean, 0 warnings, on dgx with nvcc 13.0 (`~/work/sm120a/bfat`,
`FAT_BUILD_EXIT=0`) — and so does the single-arch `"120a"` build a 5070 owner
would actually use (`~/work/sm120a/bc120`, `BUILD_C_EXIT=0`, 0 warnings, 38 TUs
carrying `sm_120a` and nothing else). `cuobjdump -lelf` over the resulting `libvllm.a` reports
**38 TUs carrying an `sm_120a` cubin and the same 38 carrying `sm_121a`** — the
fp4-MMA TU among them (`cuda_matmul_nvfp4.cu.1.sm_120a.cubin` /
`.2.sm_121a.cubin`). This is exactly what Risks #1 said could not be assumed for
a cross-family list and deliberately did not claim either way for a same-family
one: the sm12x-only PTX (`mma.sync ... kind::mxf4nvf4`) and the `__CUDA_ARCH_SPECIFIC__`
guard are satisfied by BOTH `120a` and `121a`, so per-source gencode narrowing is
not needed here. Risks #1 stands unchanged for cross-family lists (`"90a;121a"`
still cannot compile, and W7 still owns that).

**Triton AOT does NOT extend to a fat build, and that is a cubin property, not a
gap to fix.** Each vendored artifact embeds a cubin built for one `sm_<cc>`;
`cuModuleLoadData` rejects it on any other SM, so no single vendored tree is
correct for `"120a;121a"`. Previously the arch-dir derivation joined the list into
a nonexistent `sm_120a_121a` and failed with a misleading "regenerate this arch"
hint; `_triton_aot_arch_name` now detects the multi-arch case and says what is
actually wrong plus the three honest options. **The build degrades gracefully:**
`VLLM_CPP_TRITON` defaults OFF, the hand C++/CUDA kernels are the always-available
fallback, and the fat build above was produced with `-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=OFF` with
no loss of correctness. A single-arch `sm_120a` build with Triton AOT requires a
`triton_aot_vendored/sm_120a/` tree, which can only be produced ON an sm_120
board (`scripts/regen-triton-aot.sh`, `-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON_REGEN=ON`, needs
Python+Triton+ptxas). **No cubins were faked**; the directory is deliberately
absent and configuration fails loudly rather than shipping an sm_121a cubin to an
sm_120 device.

**What is PROVEN for sm_120a:** configure-time feature resolution (fp4-mma,
cutlass-nvfp4, cutlass-fp8, marlin-nvfp4, fa2 all ENABLED for `[120a]` and for
`[120a;121a]`, with no missing-tactic warning), a clean `-Werror` compile, real
`sm_120a` SASS in the archive, and the runtime seams being capability-keyed on
`major == 12` (`Sm12xFp4MmaSupports`, `LookupAttnPriority`) rather than on 121.
`BACKEND-CUDA-SM120` additionally carries an external contributor's RTX 5070 Ti
result (the discrete-Blackwell `pageable && integrated` memory classification,
PR #5) — a real sm_120 device exercising the loader/backend leaf.

**What is NOT proven:** any sm_120 execution of the gate models, kernels, or
throughput. No sm_120 board exists on this hardware. A green fatbinary link is
not execution evidence and this row does not treat it as such.

**What an RTX 50-series owner must do to validate it:**
1. `cmake -S . -B build -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120a -DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=OFF`
   (plus `-DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_DIR=<cutlass >=4.5.0>`), then build.
2. Run the unit tier first — `test_cuda_backend` (expects `pageable && integrated`
   to classify a discrete 5070 as NON-unified), `test_ops_nvfp4_fp4`,
   `test_ops_fp8_cutlass`, `test_ops_paged_attn`, `test_ops_moe_grouped`.
3. Run a gate model end to end against its golden and report token counts.
4. Optionally `-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON_REGEN=ON` on the device to produce
   `triton_aot_vendored/sm_120a/`, then rebuild with `-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=ON`.
Only step 3, reported with its counts, would move `BACKEND-CUDA-SM120` past a
build-supported claim.

### Risks/decisions

1. **A CROSS-FAMILY fat build still cannot COMPILE, and that is now loud rather
   than silent.** (AMENDED at W8, by measurement: this limitation is
   **family-scoped**. A SAME-FAMILY fat build — `"120a;121a"` — configures,
   compiles and links `-Werror` clean and carries both SASS targets, because the
   sm12x-only PTX, its `__CUDA_ARCH_SPECIFIC__` guard and the CUTLASS `Sm120` arch
   tag are satisfied by both. The paragraph below stands unchanged for a
   cross-family list such as `"90a;121a"`.) Feature ENABLEMENT is resolved per arch, but the sources are
   still compiled for the whole `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` list, so a
   `"90a;121a"` *build* fails on the sm12x-only PTX. Narrowing gencode per source
   requires vLLM's `set_gencode_flags_for_srcs`
   (`/home/mudler/_git/vllm/cmake/utils.cmake:265-345`), which only works with
   target-level `CUDA_ARCHITECTURES OFF` and fully manual gencode — CMake has no
   per-source `CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` property. That is a build restructure with
   real risk to a behavior-preserving change, and it buys nothing until a
   cross-family tactic body exists to compile. Deferred to W7 and reported by a
   configure-time WARNING naming the archs with no tactic. **This is a known
   limitation, not a fixed gap.**
2. **The `d == 256` tensor-core shape gate is untouched.** Generalizing it would
   change which kernel the gate models select. Behavior preservation wins; a
   different arch's MMA/smem shape belongs in that arch's tactic.
3. **`kGqaQG` and the WMMA tile constants remain compile-time**, tuned to GB10's
   measured 101376 B ceiling. The ceiling is now queried and ENFORCED (an
   over-budget tile gets a diagnosis naming the device instead of an opaque
   driver error), but choosing a different tile for a different budget is a
   per-arch tactic, not a constant to retune in shared code.
4. **Registered-tactic count is 1, and that is the honest number.** The registry
   makes a second architecture additive; it does not make one exist. Nothing here
   moves any `INVENTORIED` row.
5. **No product calls were reopened.** Where vLLM has an answer (the intersection
   algorithm, the capability-keyed dispatch shape) it was mirrored.
