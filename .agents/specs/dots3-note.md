# dots3-note — a DeepSeek-V3.2 text tower we mostly own, on hardware we do not

**Rows:** `MODEL-MM-dots3-note-dots3-note-for-causal-lm` (`Dots3NoteForCausalLM`),
`MODEL-SPEC-dots3-note-dots3-note-mtp` (`Dots3NoteMTPModel`) — both in
[model-matrix.md](../model-matrix.md).
**Issue:** [#699](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/699).
**Claim:** `CLAIM-MODEL-DOTS3-NOTE-W0`.
**Checkpoint:** `dots-studio/dots3-note-prev` (bf16) and
`dots-studio/dots3-note-prev-fp8`.
**Upstream:** vLLM `main` — added by
[vllm#51255](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/51255) at
`9035151d6`, last touched `170592a93` (2026-08-13,
[vllm#52172](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/52172) "Disable sequence
parallelism for Dots3 NOTE"). **NOT present at our parity pin.**
**Designated CUDA host (developer directive, 2026-08-14):** Thor, reached as the
fleet device **`thor:gpu0` through an `rc` lease and never by `ssh`** — the host
address is recorded in `environment.md` to identify the box, not as a way into
it. §6.3 records what that host can and cannot carry for this model, measured.
**Status:** W0 — spec committed, no engine code, nothing built, nothing
downloaded, no GPU used.

---

## 0. Honesty statement — what is and is not claimed

Nothing has been ported and nothing has been measured on this model.

**Measured here:** the checkpoint's file list and byte total (HF API,
`?blobs=true`); the geometry in §1 (its `config.json`); the presence and shape of
the upstream implementation (`git show origin/main:...` against a fetched
`${VLLM_SOURCE}`); the absence of the architecture at our pin; and the live state
of Thor in §6.3 (one read-only `ssh` probe).

**Read, not run:** every upstream behaviour in §2. No vLLM execution of this
model has happened on this project's hardware, and §6 explains why it cannot.

**Not established, and this is the load-bearing gap:** that any oracle for this
model runs anywhere we can reach. Until it does, no gate in §5 can bind, and no
brick past W1 may claim correctness against upstream — only against an
independent in-test reference.

A second honesty note, because this row's shape invites the error. The text tower
is *derived from* code we have gated (DeepSeek-V2 MLA, the V3.2-family DSA
indexer, the `noaux_tc` router). Derived is not identical. §4 lists four config
fields and one norm that differ from the DeepSeek defaults our code assumes; each
one silently changes numerics rather than failing loudly.

---

## 1. What the model is, measured

`dots-studio/dots3-note-prev`, `model_type = "dots3_note"`, architecture
`Dots3NoteForCausalLM`. 280B total / 16B activated (model card), text + image +
video + audio understanding, 512K positions.

**Checkpoint, from the HF API:** 131 language shards + `model-vision.safetensors`
(13.7 GB) + `model-audio.safetensors` (1.77 GB) = **~576 GB** repo total in bf16.
The `-fp8` sibling is ~290 GB. There is no smaller `dots3-note` variant in the
`dots-studio` org — the org's other models (`dots.llm1`, `dots.ocr`, `dots.mocr`,
the `dots.tts*` family) are different architectures, not scaled-down NOTEs.

### 1.1 Text tower

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `num_hidden_layers` | 46 |
| `hidden_size` | 5120, `intermediate_size` 13824 |
| `vocab_size` | 152064, `tie_word_embeddings` false |
| `max_position_embeddings` | 524288, `rope_theta` 8e7, `rope_scaling` null |
| MoE | 256 routed + 1 shared, `num_experts_per_tok` 8, `moe_intermediate_size` 1536, `moe_layer_freq` 1, `first_k_dense_replace` 1 |
| Router | `scoring_func` sigmoid, `topk_method` noaux_tc, `norm_topk_prob` true, `routed_scaling_factor` 1.0 |

**Attention is hybrid, and the two halves have different geometry.**
`layer_types` is 46 entries: **13 `full_attention`** at indices
`0, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45`, and **33 `sliding_attention`**
filling the rest (period 4 after the first pair).

| | full layers | sliding layers |
|---|---|---|
| heads | 128 | 64 (`swa_num_attention_heads`) |
| `q_lora_rank` | 1024 | 1024 (`swa_q_lora_rank`) |
| `kv_lora_rank` | 512 | **1024** (`swa_kv_lora_rank`) |
| `qk_nope_head_dim` | 128 | **192** (`swa_qk_nope_head_dim`) |
| `qk_rope_head_dim` | 64 | 64 |
| `v_head_dim` | 128 | 128 |
| rope | theta 8e7 | **theta 5e4**, `is_neox_style=False` |
| window | — | **513** (`sliding_window_size`) |
| gate | `headwise` | `headwise` (`swa_attention_gate_type`) |
| sparse indexer | yes | no |

Consequence for the KV cache: the full layers want a latent row of
`512 + 64 = 576`, the sliding layers `1024 + 64 = 1088`. Upstream reconciles this
by *padding the physical row* so both share one block shape (§2.3).

**DSA (lightning indexer)** on the full layers: `index_n_heads` 64,
`index_head_dim` 128, `index_topk` 2048.

### 1.2 Vision tower — a MoE ViT

`vision_config`: 42 layers, `embed_dim` 1536, `intermediate_size` 4224,
`moe_intermediate_size` 2112, 24 heads, `patch_size` 14, `temporal_patch_size` 1,
`spatial_merge_size` 2, `use_qk_norm` true, `is_causal` false, `post_norm` true,
`pre_pixel_shuffle` true, `use_bias` false. Adapter is `patch_merger`,
1536 → 5120, merge size 2.

The MoE is a **pyramid**: `pyramid_num_routed` is `-1` (dense) for layers 0–24,
then `4, 8, 12, … 64, 64` for layers 25–41. Router `sigmoid`, `router_scale` 1.0,
`capacity_factor` 2. ~7B total / 1.2B activated (model card).

### 1.3 Audio tower

`audio_config.encoder_type = "dots"`, wrapping a modified Whisper: `d_model`
1280, 32 encoder layers, 20 heads, `encoder_ffn_dim` 5120, 128 mel bins,
`max_source_positions` **6000**, `activation_function` **swiglu**. Plus
`use_conv2d_stem` true, `use_rope` true (partial rotary 0.5, theta 1e4),
`use_rms_norm` true, `use_causal` false, `downsample_hidden_size` 480,
`chunk_seconds` 60, `conv_chunksize` 500, adapter 1280 → 5120, 16 kHz. ~800M
(model card). Audio placeholders are `<|audio_comp_start|>` /
`<|audio_comp_pad|>` / `<|audio_comp_end|>`.

### 1.4 MTP

`Dots3NoteMTPModel`. The config class defaults `num_nextn_predict_layers` to
**1** — one nextn layer, not three. The model card's "three-token speculative
decoding" therefore describes the *speculation depth* the head is driven at, not
a count of heads; that reading is inferred from the config default and is **not
verified against a checkpoint**, because the shard index has not been read. W2
resolves it from `model.safetensors.index.json`.

---

## 2. Upstream chain, `file:line`

Paths under `${VLLM_SOURCE}` = `/home/mudler/_git/vllm` at `origin/main`. Note
the package layout: this is **not** `vllm/model_executor/models/dots3_note.py`.
It is `vllm/models/dots3_note/{common,nvidia}/`, the same platform-split shape
DeepSeek-V4 uses — 15 files, ~5.7k LoC.

### 2.1 Registration

- `vllm/model_executor/models/registry.py:375` —
  `"Dots3NoteForCausalLM": ("vllm.models.dots3_note", "Dots3NoteForCausalLM")`.
- `registry.py:662` — `"Dots3NoteMTPModel": ("vllm.models.dots3_note", "Dots3NoteMTP")`.
- `vllm/transformers_utils/configs/dots3_note.py:7` —
  `class Dots3NoteConfig(DeepseekV3Config)`. Read this file before anything else;
  §4 is entirely about what it sets.

### 2.2 The text tower is subclassed from DeepSeek

`vllm/models/dots3_note/nvidia/model.py`:

| dots3 class | base | line |
|---|---|---|
| `Dots3NoteMoE` | `DeepseekV2MoE` | `:76` |
| `Dots3NotePaddedMLAAttention` | `MLAAttention` | `:204` |
| `Dots3NoteFullAttention` | `DeepseekV2MLAAttention` | `:219` |
| `Dots3NoteSlidingAttention` | `nn.Module` (built directly) | `:329` |
| `Dots3NoteDecoderLayer` | `DeepseekV32DecoderLayer` | `:481` |
| `Dots3NoteModel` | `DeepseekV32Model` | `:549` |
| `Dots3NoteLanguageModelForCausalLM` | `DeepseekV32ForCausalLM` | `:681` |

The shared attention body is the free function `_forward_note_mla`
(`model.py:135`), used by both the full and the sliding classes. Its deltas over
plain DeepSeek MLA are exactly four:

1. `q_c = q_a_layernorm(q_c) * q_lora_scale` and
   `kv_c_normed = kv_a_layernorm(kv_c) * kv_lora_scale` (`:154`, `:160`) — see §4.2.
2. `k_pe = k_rope_only_layernorm(k_pe)` (`:161`) — an **extra RMSNorm over the
   64-dim rope-only slice of k**, which DeepSeek does not have.
3. The headwise gate (`:246-262`): `gate = g_proj(hidden_states)`,
   `sigmoid` in **fp32** then cast back, reshape attention output to
   `[-1, num_heads, v_head_dim]`, multiply per head, flatten.
4. The indexer runs only when `attention.is_sparse` (`:186`) — i.e. never on the
   sliding layers, which set `self.indexer = None` / `is_sparse = False`
   (`model.py:430-432`).

`Dots3NoteMoE` (`:76`) is `DeepseekV2MoE` with the shared expert lifted out and
rebuilt at a **block-padded** intermediate size (`_padded_mlp_size:63`) so
blockwise-FP8 weights divide across TP ranks. At TP=1 with no
`weight_block_size` this padding is the identity — record it, do not port it
speculatively.

### 2.3 Sliding-window MLA — the new machinery

`vllm/models/dots3_note/nvidia/attention.py`, 807 lines, and the reason this row
is not a mechanical port:

- `_gather_swa_kv_kernel:48` — Triton kernel gathering the windowed KV rows.
- `_apply_swa_score_mask_kernel:118` — the window mask over scores.
- `_build_sliding_window_metadata:191`, `_SlidingWindowChunk:171`,
  `_SlidingWindowMetadata:186` — chunked window bookkeeping.
- `Dots3NoteMLAMetadataBuilder(TritonMLAMetadataBuilder):306`, including
  `_reserve_attn_logits_workspace:315`.
- `Dots3NoteTritonMLAImpl(TritonMLAImpl):438` with `_forward_swa_mqa:469`,
  `forward_mha:564`, `forward_mqa:655`.
- `Dots3NoteFlashAttnPrefillBackend:257` with `run_sliding_window:278`.
- `Dots3NotePaddedSparseImpl(FlashAttnMLASparseImpl):689` — the full layers,
  with `_logical_cache:692` narrowing the padded physical row back to the logical
  576 and `do_kv_cache_update:696`.

The padding contract lives in `model.py:204-217`: `Dots3NotePaddedMLAAttention`
overrides `get_kv_cache_spec` to report `physical_head_size`, so full and sliding
layers allocate the same block while each reads its own logical width.

### 2.4 Vision

`nvidia/vision.py` (677) — `DotsMoEVitConfig:27`, `MoESwiGLUFFN:139`,
`MoESwiGLUFFNFP8:242`, `DotsPatchEmbed:321`, `MoEVisionBlock:352`,
`PixelShuffleAdapter:419`, `PatchMergerAdapter:464`, `DotsMoEVitModel:508`
(`get_pos_ids_by_grid:565`, `rot_pos_emb:601`, cu_seqlens builders `:609`/`:621`).
`nvidia/vision_attention.py` (477). `nvidia/vision_moe.py` (149) —
`note_vision_fused_moe_fp8`, whose docstring states the memory-format trap
directly: *"the native NOTE encoder keeps dynamic activation scales as FP32
instead of rounding them to E8M0"*, weight scales block 128×128, activations
quantized per token/group-128.

### 2.5 Audio

`nvidia/audio_encoder.py` (745) — `RotaryEmbedding:47`,
`WhisperPositionalEmbedding:184`, `WhisperAttention:196`,
`WhisperEncoderLayer:310`, `DotsSpeechEncoder:437` with three stems
(`_forward_conv2d_stem:573`, `_forward_conv1d_stem:594`,
`_forward_latent_stem:607`) and `_temporal_mask:538`. `nvidia/audio.py` (305) is
the vLLM-side wrapper.

### 2.6 Multimodal front end and MTP

`nvidia/multimodal.py:49` `Dots3NoteForCausalLM(nn.Module, SupportsMultiModal,
SupportsPP)` — `get_placeholder_str:65`, `_process_image_input:144`,
`_process_audio_input:156`, `_process_video_input:172`, `embed_multimodal:225`,
`get_mm_mapping:300`. `common/processor.py` (811) and `common/video.py` (497)
carry the prompt-side expansion and frame sampling.
`nvidia/mtp.py:31,88,141` — `Dots3NoteMultiTokenPredictorLayer`,
`Dots3NoteMultiTokenPredictor(DeepseekV32MultiTokenPredictor)`,
`Dots3NoteMTP(DeepseekV32MTP)` with `has_own_embed_tokens = True`,
`has_own_lm_head = False`.

---

## 3. Reuse versus new

### 3.1 What we already own and gate

| Piece | Ours | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| MLA: fused qkv_a, q_lora branch, two RMSNorms, split RoPE, kv_b | `src/vllm/model_executor/models/deepseek_v2.cpp` | SACRED 8/8 token-exact on DeepSeek-V2-Lite |
| DSA lightning indexer + top-k | `deepseek_v4_dsa.cpp`, [dsa-topk-bounds.md](dsa-topk-bounds.md) | unit-gated |
| `noaux_tc` sigmoid router + `e_score_correction_bias` + shared experts | `deepseek_v2`, `laguna_ops.cpp`, `kimi_k3.cpp`, `nemotron_h_weights.cpp:309` | `tests/vt/test_ops_moe_router_grouped.cpp` |
| 256-expert grouped-GEMM MoE | DeepSeek-V4 MoE path | measured decode |
| MTP draft head + lossless self-spec verify | `v1/worker/gpu/spec_decode/mtp/speculator.cpp`, `deepseek_v4.cpp` | `test_deepseek_v4_mtp` 5/5 |
| ViT + 2-D RoPE + patch merger, **image and video** | `qwen3_vl_vision.cpp` | STRICT 32/32 image, 32/32 video |
| Whisper-class audio encoder + FA-2 attention | `whisper_audio.cpp`, `voxtral.cpp` | audio→text gate 16/16 |
| MM processor / placeholder expansion / OpenAI content parts | `multimodal/`, `chat_mm.cpp` | `test_chat_mm` 8/8 |

That is the majority of the parameter count and most of the decode step.

### 3.2 What does not exist here

1. **Windowed MLA.** Every MLA path we have is full-attention over a paged cache
   (`deepseek_v4_registry.cpp` says so explicitly: `is_hybrid = false`). 33 of 46
   layers need a 513-wide window. **Largest single brick.**
2. **Heterogeneous MLA KV spec** — two logical latent widths sharing one physical
   block, plus a `_logical_cache`-equivalent narrowing on read.
3. **Headwise attention gate**, the extra `k_rope_only_layernorm`, and the two
   lora rescale scalars. Individually trivial, all on the hot path, and all three
   are invisible to a shape check.
4. **MoE ViT** — every vision tower we have is dense. Needs the pyramid schedule,
   the sigmoid router with `capacity_factor`, and the FP32-scale FP8 MoE formula
   of §2.4.
5. **`dots` audio stem** — conv2d stem, RoPE, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, 6000 positions,
   60 s chunking. Our Whisper block has none of these.
6. **`dots3_note` config parsing** in `hf_config.cpp`, including the four
   defaults of §4 that the checkpoint's `config.json` does **not** carry.
7. **GGUF k-quant arm.** llama.cpp has no `dots3_note` architecture, so the
   converter is ours to write and there is no quant-matched llama.cpp
   comparison for this row. Per AGENTS.md the arm is owed, not optional; an
   unimplemented arm refuses with a message naming the missing piece.

---

## 4. Config traps — what `config.json` does not say

`Dots3NoteConfig.__init__` (`transformers_utils/configs/dots3_note.py:12-25`)
sets four defaults that are **absent from the published `config.json`**. A port
that reads only the checkpoint gets all four wrong, and every one of them is
numerically silent.

1. **`n_group = 1`, `topk_group = 1`.** Upstream's comment is explicit: *"Do not
   inherit DeepSeek-V3's 8-group/4-group router defaults: Note was trained with
   an ungrouped (1/1) noaux_tc router … A different grouping changes the selected
   experts at every MoE layer."* Our `noaux_tc` router is gated at V3's grouped
   dims; this row must drive it ungrouped.
2. **`indexer_rope_interleave = True`.** dots3 projects indexer RoPE coordinates
   in **adjacent (GPT-J) pairs**; DeepSeek-V3.2 defaults to **split-half (NeoX)**
   when the flag is absent. Our DSA indexer was ported against the V3.2 default,
   so this rotates different learned coordinates.
3. **`num_nextn_predict_layers = 1`** (§1.4).
4. The base class is `DeepseekV3Config`, so anything not overridden inherits
   V3's default — check each field we read rather than assuming the JSON is
   complete.

Two more that *are* in the JSON but differ from our assumptions:

5. **`apply_mla_qkv_lora_rescale: true`** ⇒
   `q_lora_scale = sqrt(hidden_size / q_lora_rank)` and
   `kv_lora_scale = sqrt(hidden_size / kv_lora_rank)` applied *after* the
   respective layernorms (`model.py:154,160`). For the full layers that is
   `sqrt(5120/1024)` and `sqrt(5120/512)`; for sliding, `sqrt(5120/1024)` twice.
6. **`is_neox_style=False` on the sliding rope only** (`model.py:404`), with its
   own theta 5e4 against the full layers' 8e7.

**Gate obligation:** each of the six gets a RED-first unit assertion before the
layer that consumes it is written. A wrong value here produces plausible tokens,
which is precisely the class of defect a token gate cannot catch when no oracle
is available to compare against.

---

## 5. Gates

**Correctness first, and the gate form is chosen by measurement, not in advance**
— capture K=5 greedy oracle runs; deterministic ⇒ STRICT token-exact, otherwise
the ratified near-tie distributional bar. That decision cannot be made until §6
produces a running oracle.

Until then, each brick gates against an **independent in-test double-precision
reference** written from the upstream source, with RED-first mutation proof.
That is a consistency gate, not a correctness gate, and the spec says so at every
brick: a shared-helper comparison proves the two arms agree, never that either is
right.

Owed measurements when hardware exists: token gate; decode/prefill throughput and
TTFT against production-configured vLLM (never `--enforce-eager`); memory; and
the quantized arms including GGUF k-quants.

---

## 6. Oracles and hardware — the blocking section

### 6.1 The oracle is vLLM, past the pin

vLLM is the primary oracle and implements this model, so no secondary oracle is
admissible for it. But our parity pin is `555967922` (0.26.0.dev0, 2026-07-26,
[upstream-sync.md](../upstream-sync.md)), and the checkout at that SHA contains
only `dots_ocr.py` — verified, not assumed. dots3 exists on `main` only.

This row is therefore **beyond-pin**, alongside `KimiK3ForConditionalGeneration`
and `MuseGlimmerForConditionalGeneration`. Gating it requires a pin advance,
which is a full sync cycle with every affected row reconciled — not a version
transcription. Worse for scheduling: upstream is still changing this code
(`#52172` landed 2026-08-13, the day before this spec), so a pin advance taken
now captures a moving implementation.

### 6.2 Memory — the model does not fit anywhere we own

| Vehicle | Size | Fits GB10 (~119 GiB)? | Fits Thor (~122 GiB)? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dots3-note-prev` bf16 | ~576 GB | no | no |
| `dots3-note-prev-fp8` | ~290 GB | no | no |
| hypothetical ~2 bpw GGUF (ours) | ~75–90 GiB + towers | plausible | plausible |

Upstream's own recipe is `--tensor-parallel-size 8` on H100s. Two of our boxes
together are ~240 GiB and there is no TP-over-LAN path here, so aggregating them
is not a plan.

**The consequence, stated plainly: there is no configuration in which the vLLM
oracle runs this model on hardware this project has.** Our own arm may well run
at ≤2 bpw — that is the ds4flash IQ2_XXS pattern — but an arm with no oracle
beside it produces no parity number. This is the same wall
[deepseek-v4-flash.md](deepseek-v4-flash.md) hit at 156.7 GiB, three times worse,
and unlike that row there is no smaller published checkpoint to retreat to.

### 6.3 Thor as the designated e2e host — what it can carry

Developer directive 2026-08-14: use Thor as the CUDA host for end-to-end
verification. Reach it as the fleet device `thor:gpu0` through an `rc` lease and
never by `ssh`; [environment.md](../environment.md) carries the recipe. Probed
read-only over `ssh` on 2026-08-14, before that rule existed:

```
hostname   kairos-4db2      aarch64, 14 cores
memory     122 GB total, 118 GB available
disk       /home 918G, 123 GiB free   (/ is a 4.4G loop, 1.3G free)
toolchain  python3 present; NO nvcc, NO cmake, NO ninja, NO ~/venvs
nvidia-smi refuses under non-interactive ssh:
           "NvRmMemInitNvmap failed: error Permission denied"
```

**Two of those five lines are false now, and the block stays as the probe it
was rather than being corrected in place.** Free disk read 362 GB when it was
measured again on 2026-08-15, and `nvidia-smi` does not refuse. The points below
carry both corrections.

Three facts follow, and they are recorded rather than worked around.

1. **Thor cannot host the oracle for this model, and the reason is RAM.** The
   290 GB FP8 checkpoint is more than twice the box's 122 GB of memory, so the
   model cannot be resident whatever the disk holds. **The disk half of this
   argument is WITHDRAWN.** W0 wrote it as "290 GB exceeds both its 122 GB of
   RAM and its 123 GiB of free disk — the checkpoint will not even land", and
   the very next measurement of the same volume read 362 GB free, which is more
   than 290. On that number the checkpoint lands and then fails to load. Both
   probes were correct when they were taken, which is the point: free space is
   not a stable premise and a memory ceiling is. Designating the host does not
   change §6.2; it fixes *where our arm and our unit gates run*, which is a real
   and separate thing.
2. **Thor needed provisioning first** (W0.5) — **DONE 2026-08-15, and its
   recipe was REPLACED on 2026-08-19**; both the recipe and the `ctest` baseline
   live in [environment.md](../environment.md). Two corrections to the read-only
   probe above. `nvidia-smi` was never broken: it runs plainly inside a leased
   worker, exit 0, with no `NvRm` line at all, so `NvRmMemInitNvmap failed:
   Permission denied` was a privilege artefact of the unprivileged `ssh` shell
   and not a driver fault. And the toolchain does not go on the host at all —
   `/` is a read-only loop on an immutable image, so the box keeps no host CUDA
   and the CUDA 13.0.88 toolkit comes from the leased worker's own
   `/usr/local/cuda`. Free disk on `/home` measured 362 GB, not the 123 GiB the
   earlier probe read. Still owed if oracle work is ever wanted here: a vLLM
   build, which §6.2 says cannot serve THIS model regardless.
3. **Thor's standing traps apply.** `vm.overcommit_memory=1`: the kernel grants
   memory it cannot back and touching those pages takes the whole machine down
   (observed three times on 2026-08-11). Any run here is sized conservatively
   and never `-j` parallel across model gates. **The "zero swap" half of that
   trap is now stale** — a leased worker read 30 GiB of swap, all free, on
   2026-08-19 — but the reboots were observed and the hazard stands; see
   [environment.md](../environment.md) for the measurement and what it does and
   does not change.

What Thor *is* good for on this row: sm_110 runtime coverage (it is our only
non-GB10 CUDA host), our own low-bit arm end to end, and every unit/brick gate in
§7 — none of which need the 290 GB checkpoint.

### 6.4 How this row proceeds — DECIDED

**Developer decision, 2026-08-15: option B.** The row ports brick by brick
against independent references, ships our own low-bit arm on Thor, and carries
the end-to-end parity gate as an OPEN GAP rather than a satisfied one. A and C
below are recorded because the reasoning stays useful if the hardware position
changes.

What choosing B commits this row to, stated plainly so no later reader has to
infer it:

- **No performance number for dots3-note is claimable, on any axis, for as long
  as B holds.** Not a ratio, not a floor, not "comparable to". The oracle cannot
  run here (§6.2), so there is no denominator. A number measured against our own
  arm alone is a self-comparison and says nothing about parity.
- **Correctness claims are bounded by their instrument.** Each brick gates
  against an independent in-test double-precision reference written from the
  upstream source. That establishes that two implementations agree; it does not
  establish that either matches vLLM. Every brick says so in its own evidence
  cell rather than relying on this paragraph.
- **The e2e gate is owed, not waived.** It stays an open gap on the row until
  either the pin advances onto hardware that runs the model, or a smaller
  checkpoint appears. `## Owed` in this spec is where it lives.
- **No ceiling is declared** — unchanged, and the reason B is acceptable at all.

The alternatives, kept for the record:

- **A — rent 8×H100.** The only path to a real parity gate. Cost and data-egress
  are the developer's call; nothing in-repo authorizes it.
- **B — unit-gated bricks, e2e owed.** Port each brick against an independent
  reference, ship our low-bit arm on Thor, and record the parity gate as an open
  gap on the row. Honest, and it is what the row will do by default.
- **C — park at W0.** The row stays `SPIKE`, the scope is on record, and the work
  waits for either a smaller checkpoint or hardware.

Whichever is chosen, **no ceiling is declared** and the gap stays open.

## 7. Phases

W0 is this document. §6.4 is answered — option B — so the phases below are
dispatchable in order, under the constraints that answer imposes.

- **W0 — scope (this).** Arch map, reuse-vs-new, config traps, quant/HW fit,
  oracle plan, rows. **DONE.**
- **W0.5 — provision Thor. DONE 2026-08-15; recipe REPLACED 2026-08-19.** The
  recipe is [environment.md](../environment.md), under the Jetson Thor profile:
  one `rc run -d thor:gpu0` job that builds and tests inside the leased worker,
  which carries cmake 3.28.3, ninja 1.11.1, gcc 13.3.0 and python3, and which
  apt-installs the CUDA toolkit as a step because **the toolkit is NOT in the
  worker image** — both of this lane's jobs found nvcc already present and both
  were reading another job's leftover install in a long-lived container. **The
  recipe this row first landed is withdrawn, not merely superseded.** It
  prescribed `ssh` to the box plus `sudo -n docker build` and `sudo -n docker
  run` against a digest-pinned image, which bypasses the GPU lease and makes the
  fleet report the box free while a job is on it. The image was also
  unnecessary: a job installs the toolkit itself in one step, which is what
  `dgx:gpu0` jobs already do (#1213). A HOST toolchain was
  and remains rejected on evidence rather than taste — `/` is a read-only 4.4 G
  loop on an immutable Kairos image, so `apt install` into it does not exist.
  The build is CUDA-real, and the proof is now two checks rather than three:
  configure prints `CUDA target architectures: 110`, and `libvllm.so` links
  `libcudart.so.13` and `libcublasLt.so.13` over 32 `*.cu.o` objects. **The
  third check cannot be run as W0.5 wrote it** — it called for
  `cuobjdump --list-elf`, and `cuobjdump` is absent from the leased worker even
  after the CUDA `PATH` prepend, so the command yields an empty result that
  looks like a clean one. `environment.md` records the fix and marks
  "30 objects, one `sm_110` cubin each" as an unverified 2026-08-15 claim. A
  kernel does run on the device: `test_cuda_backend` reports `sm_110`,
  `integrated=1`, `UnifiedMemory=true`, 6/6 cases and 25/25 assertions.

  **The gate as written — "the existing suite passes there" — is NOT met, and
  it was the wrong gate.** Re-measured at `0764ded2b` on 2026-08-19 inside an
  `rc run -d thor:gpu0` lease, the baseline is 553 tests, **534 passed /
  3 skipped / 16 red** (`ctest -j1`, 419.97 s). It read 485 tests / 15 red at
  `2daa3287f`. A further re-measurement at `944d7d947` reached configure and
  then lost the box to a `worker_lost` event, so **the baseline is STALE by 144
  commits** — 100 of them touching `src/`, `include/`, `tests/` or
  `CMakeLists.txt` — and says so; re-measuring is owed under
  [#955](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/955).

  **The 16 split into seven causes, and the split is non-overlapping so it sums
  to 16.** An earlier draft's tally reached only 15, because the three
  `qwen3_5_gdn_spec_routing` tests belong to two descriptions at once and were
  counted under neither cleanly. They are counted once below, under GB10, with
  the second fact noted rather than added.

  | Cause | Count | Tests |
  |---|---:|---|
  | no vendored FA-2 — the build correctly refusing what the arch lacks | 4 | `test_deepseek_v2_forward`, `test_ops_mla_prefill`, `test_ops_mla_chunked_context`, `test_mla_attention_block` |
  | the TEST hardcodes GB10 | 2 | `test_platform` (sm_12x family), `test_op_parity` (a dgx-only golden that runs anyway) |
  | already red on GB10, so not an sm_110 fact ([#907](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/907)) | 5 | `test_linear_method`, `test_capi`, and the three `qwen3_5_gdn_spec_routing` tests — which ALSO improved `SEGFAULT` → `Failed` here, counted once |
  | FP8 ops falling through to the portable tier and crashing ([#1725](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1725) — **not** [#960](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/960), closed three days before the measurement) | 2 | `test_ops_fp8_cutlass`, `test_ops_matmul_fp8_block_cuda` |
  | an absent `shellcheck`, an instrument not a verdict ([#961](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/961)) | 1 | `test_serve_low_tools` |
  | the live Marlin NVFP4 disagreement ([#962](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/962)) | 1 | `test_ops_moe_grouped` |
  | arrived since 2026-08-15, UNATTRIBUTED | 1 | `test_gguf_device_fit_reach` |
  | **total** | **16** | |

  None of those can be
  made green by this row and none is this row's debt. Asking for "all green" on
  a host whose arch legitimately lacks features would either block every brick
  forever or invite someone to weaken a test to pass. **The gate that actually
  binds is therefore differential, over `(name, failure mode)` PAIRS: a row
  regresses on Thor when it adds a name, or changes a recorded mode FOR THE
  WORSE — worst first, `SEGFAULT`/`Subprocess aborted`/`Timeout`, then `Failed`,
  then `Skipped`/`Not Run`, then passing. A crash becoming a clean assertion
  failure is progress rather than a regression, and this lane's own run saw
  three such improvements, so the direction is not a hypothetical refinement.
  `Skipped` ranks BELOW `Failed`: a red test that starts skipping has stopped
  being measured, not started passing, and three tests already skip here for an
  absent checkpoint. A name leaving the list therefore counts as an improvement
  only when it has been SEEN to pass.** The list
  itself, with a mode and a first-failing assertion per test, is
  [#955](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/955), the sm_110 counterpart
  of [#907](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/907).

  **"Only if it lengthens the list" is what this gate said when W0.5 landed, and
  it is provably too weak.** Counting names scores a crash as no change. Between
  `5a0ffe9e3` and `2daa3287f` five tests went `Failed` → `SEGFAULT` with no name
  change, and the list grew by one only because the same upstream change also
  shipped a new test file. A name-counting gate would have scored
  [#960](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/960) GREEN on five of the six
  crashes it introduced. The mode column is part of the baseline, not
  decoration, and it costs no extra measurement because `ctest` prints the mode
  beside every failure.

  That gate has to be re-derived, not remembered, and it has now moved twice.
  Two SHAs a few hours apart on 2026-08-15 read 484/14 → 485/15, because a
  change on `main` turned a clean FP8 refusal into a segfault. Four days later
  at `0764ded2b` it reads 553/16: three names arrived, two left, and the three
  `qwen3_5_gdn_spec_routing` tests went `SEGFAULT` → `Failed`, which a
  name-counting gate would have reported as a single regression and nothing
  else. **Re-measure whenever the base moves across `src/`, `include/`,
  `tests/` or `CMakeLists.txt`.**

  Two consequences this row carries forward. Thor's MLA prefill throws rather
  than computes, so the W3/W4 attention bricks cannot be verified end to end
  here on the FA-2 path at all — their gate stays the in-test double-precision
  reference of §5, exactly as §6.4 requires under option B. And W9's
  blockwise-FP8 arm has no native kernel on this box, and the fallback that
  stands in for it currently crashes, so that arm is owed rather than pending.
- **W1 — config + registry.** `dots3_note` in `hf_config.cpp` with RED-first
  assertions on all six §4 traps; `dots3_note_registry.cpp` as an additive TU
  registering `Dots3NoteForCausalLM` (and `Dots3NoteMTPModel` as INVENTORIED).
  Forward refuses loudly. Gate: config parse unit tests; loader accounts for
  100% of tensors on a single-layer slice from the shard index.
- **W2 — weight map.** `model.safetensors.index.json` read for real: the
  full/sliding split, `g_proj`, `k_rope_only_layernorm`, the indexer tensors, the
  256-expert w13/w2 mapping, the nextn tail (resolving §1.4), and the two tower
  files. Gate: name-map checker, no unclaimed tensor.
- **W3 — full-attention layer.** `_forward_note_mla` over our DeepSeek MLA:
  lora rescales, `k_rope_only_layernorm`, headwise gate, DSA indexer at
  `indexer_rope_interleave=True`. Gate: independent double-precision reference,
  RED-first, mutation-proved.
- **W4 — sliding-window MLA.** The §2.3 stack: windowed metadata, the gather, the
  score mask, and the padded/heterogeneous KV spec. The largest brick; likely
  splits further once W3 lands.
- **W5 — MoE.** Ungrouped `noaux_tc` at 256/8 + the shared expert. Mostly
  routing our existing path at new dims.
- **W6 — vision tower.** Dense ViT half first, then the pyramid MoE and the
  FP32-scale FP8 formula. Reuses `qwen3_vl_vision` structure.
- **W7 — audio tower.** The `dots` stem deltas over our Whisper encoder.
- **W8 — MM front end + ABI.** Processor, video sampling, placeholder expansion,
  `<|audio_comp_*|>`, `include/vllm.h` surface, the example server as a thin
  client.
- **W9 — quantized arms.** Blockwise FP8 and the owed GGUF k-quant arm +
  converter.
- **W10 — MTP.** `Dots3NoteMTPModel` over the existing speculator seam.
- **W11 — gates.** Whatever §6.4 permits: full SACRED if A, the recorded-gap
  form if B.

## 8. Risks

- **R1 — the oracle never becomes reachable.** Primary risk; §6.4 is its only
  mitigation. Everything else is downstream of it.
- **R2 — upstream is still moving.** `#52172` landed the day before this spec.
  Pin against a specific `main` SHA per brick and record it, or the "ported from"
  anchors rot.
- **R3 — the four silent config traps** (§4). Mitigation: RED-first assertion per
  trap, before the consuming layer exists.
- **R4 — windowed MLA is genuinely new** and upstream needed two Triton kernels
  plus its own metadata builder to get it. Do not scope W4 as an increment on our
  paged full-attention MLA.
- **R5 — the vision MoE's FP32 activation scales** (§2.4) are the exact shape of
  a too-wide/too-narrow dtype defect that a token gate cannot see. Check the
  memory format against upstream explicitly, per
  [porting.md](../porting.md).
- **R6 — no llama.cpp comparison** for the GGUF arm, so the quantized floor has
  no external reference. Record it as a gap rather than substituting a different
  model's number.
- **R7 — Thor's overcommit + zero swap** takes the box down on an oversized run
  (§6.3). Size every run; never stack them.

## 8.1 A record constraint discovered while landing W0

Advancing this row to `ACTIVE` requires this spec to grow the **structured
headings** `check-agent-record.py` enforces for an active row: Scope, Upstream
chain, Our baseline, Port map, Tests to port, Gates, Dependencies. The W0 shape
above deliberately does not have them, and the checker accepts that at `SPIKE`.
Measured by mutating the row's state to `ACTIVE` in a scratch copy and reading
the seven errors it produced. Whoever takes W1 owes that restructure in the same
change as the lifecycle move, not afterwards.

## Owed

Carried openly under option B (§6.4), not waived:

- **The end-to-end parity gate against vLLM** — token-exact or the ratified
  near-tie form, chosen by measurement. Blocked on §6.2 (no host we own runs the
  oracle at any published precision) and on the beyond-pin position of §6.1.
  Owner: this row. Issue [#699](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/699).
- **Every throughput, latency and memory axis.** Open by construction while the
  gate above is owed; see §6.4 for why no number is claimable meanwhile.

## 9. Stop conditions

- Any brick whose only available comparison is a shared helper stops and says so
  rather than claiming correctness.
- If W2's tensor accounting disagrees with §1 geometry, stop and reconcile this
  spec before writing a layer.
- If a pin advance is attempted and any affected row cannot be reconciled, the
  advance stops; this row waits rather than moving the pin around it.
- No throughput number is quoted for this model until a same-tool trace exists
  for both arms on identical workloads.

## Now

W0 complete; **§6.4 answered on 2026-08-15 with option B**, so the row is no
longer blocked on a decision. **W0.5 landed the same day.** The row stays
`SPIKE` until W1 lands code — provisioning a host is not porting a model.

**W0.5 — DONE, and its RECIPE was replaced on 2026-08-19.** `thor:gpu0` builds
vllm.cpp with CUDA ON for sm_110, runs kernels on the device, and has a recorded
`ctest` baseline. The full recipe — how to stage a tree for the lease, the one
`PATH` prepend that produces `nvcc`, the build and `ctest` flags, the corrected
`nvidia-smi` reading and the per-test failure table — is in
[environment.md](../environment.md) under the Jetson Thor profile, not here:
Thor is the project's only non-GB10 CUDA host, so it belongs to every row that
wants sm_110 coverage rather than to this one.

**What the first version of W0.5 got wrong, corrected in place because `main`
is never rewritten.** It prescribed `ssh` to the box plus `sudo -n docker build`
and `sudo -n docker run` against a digest-pinned image. That reaches a fleet
device outside its lease, so the fleet reports `thor:gpu0` free while a job is
on it, and the image was never needed — the leased worker already carries nvcc
13.0.88, cmake 3.28.3, ninja 1.11.1 and python 3.12.3. The recipe is deleted
rather than kept as an alternative. Two of its factual claims went with it: that
`nvidia-smi` "dies" unprivileged, which was reading a successful report's stderr
as a verdict, and that `shellcheck` was in the recorded Dockerfile, which its
package list never contained.

**Baseline, re-measured in the environment now prescribed:** `0764ded2b`,
`ctest -j1` inside an `rc run -d thor:gpu0` lease, 419.97 s — **553 tests, 534
passed / 3 skipped / 16 red.** **It is STALE by 144 commits** — 100 of them
touching `src/`, `include/`, `tests/` or `CMakeLists.txt`, 319 files and
+76,570 lines — because the re-measurement at `944d7d947` lost the box mid-build.
One of those commits, `cffe59b02`, rewrites the reference-tier dispatch this
baseline names as the cause of its two FP8 SEGFAULTs, on the unified-memory axis
that Thor sits on, so those two rows are specifically suspect. Stated in
`environment.md` and owed under
[#955](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/955) rather than papered over. One of the 16, `test_serve_low_tools`, is the
absent `shellcheck` ([#961](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/961)) and
is carried as a named entry rather than installed away; the same job proved it
is exactly the instrument by installing `shellcheck` and re-running that test
alone to green.

The W0.5 gate as originally written ("the existing suite passes there") is not
met and was the wrong gate; §7 records the differential gate that replaces it
and the reasoning for it. That gate is keyed on `(name, failure mode)` pairs,
not on the length of the list — the version that shipped counted names, and
five `Failed` → `SEGFAULT` transitions prove counting names is too weak. The
lane earned its keep immediately by finding
[#960](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/960) — an FP8 refusal on `main`
that became a silent portable-CPU fallback and a segfault, invisible on GB10 —
and it earned it again on 2026-08-19, when the same three tests came back as
`Failed` rather than `SEGFAULT` and a name-counting gate would have seen
nothing.

**Next dispatchable: W1 — `dots3_note` config + registry**, with the six §4
traps RED-first, and owing the §8.1 heading restructure in the same change as
the lifecycle move to `ACTIVE`.
