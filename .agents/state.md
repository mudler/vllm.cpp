# State log (append; newest last)

- **2026-07-02** — Project kicked off. Repo created (`mudler/vllm.cpp`),
  pushed to GitHub. vLLM reference mapped (engine core + full feature
  inventory via subagents). Gates defined (Qwen3.6 NVFP4 parity on GB10 +
  GGUF + library + tools/grammars + streaming/non-streaming + e2e suites).
  `.agents/porting-inventory.md` (then docs/) written with T0–T3 tiers. Core design doc
  rev 2 (CUDA-first on GB10, hybrid GDN+MoE+NVFP4 in T0, MRV2, library-first).
  Upstream synced to `e24d1b24`. AGENTS.md restructured as index over
  `.agents/*.md`. NOT STARTED: any implementation. NEXT: user reviews
  inventory + design doc → writing-plans for milestone M0.
- **2026-07-02 (later)** — Project made agent-maintainable: inventory moved to
  `.agents/porting-inventory.md` as a *living parity record* (inline status
  markers + upkeep rules), `parity-ledger.md` created (append-only: every
  change → what it does vs vLLM, upstream PR refs, verification),
  `roadmap.md` created (M0–M3 broken into PR-sized units with DoD),
  `workflow.md` rewritten as the agent session protocol. NEXT unchanged:
  user review → writing-plans for M0.1.
