  builds from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/releases/tag/v0.0.2).
- **2026-08** **MiniMax-H3 generates video with audio.** All tasks run through `POST /v1/videos`;
  use Q4_K_M.
- **2026-08** **MXFP4 holds parity with vLLM.** Qwen3-8B MXFP4 runs W4A16 Marlin by default,

- **2026-08** **Vulkan matches llama.cpp on a 27B.** Qwen3.6-27B decodes **4.36 vs llama.cpp Vulkan
  4.35 tok/s** on GB10, up from 2.40. A narrow pass: the 0.69% leg spread is the noise floor.
  Prefill **21.5x**, a self-ratio. Denominator SUPERSEDED.

vllm.cpp is a from-scratch C++20 inference engine chasing three things at once: be the
**smallest** thing you can deploy, be the **fastest** on the hardware you already own, and still
carry **every feature people actually want**. No Python and no PyTorch at inference time.

It gets there by taking the best of each engine rather than reimplementing one of them.
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)'s serving core (continuous batching, block-paged KV,
automatic prefix caching, speculative decoding). [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)'s
scheduling ideas (RadixAttention, LPM cache-aware admission, jump-forward decoding).
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)'s deployment story (one library behind a flat C
ABI, GGUF straight off the shelf, and compute directly on the quantized blocks). MLX's GEMM where it
wins on Apple Silicon. Safetensors and GGUF, CUDA and CPU and Metal and Vulkan, from one source tree.

Every architecture is gated **token-for-token against vLLM** on the same workload. Speed claims use
the reference engine's production configuration.

![vllm.cpp vs vLLM on Qwen3.6-27B: identical output at every concurrency](benchmarks/media/concurrency_race.gif)

> The same model, the same prompts, side by side: **token-for-token identical output**, finishing a
> hair ahead. That margin is inside our noise band at five of the six concurrencies
> ([full clip](benchmarks/media/concurrency_race.mp4)).

Where that stands today:

- **Small.** **66 MiB** of binary against a **9.1 GiB** vLLM install, both measured on the same GB10:
  about **140x less to deploy**, serving the same model in **24.88 GiB of peak host memory against
  vLLM's 28.18**. No interpreter in the process, and 0 bytes of bundled CUDA userspace.
- **Fast.** On Qwen3.6-27B we **match vLLM's throughput** against its graphed production config,
  ahead at all six concurrencies but only c1 outside our noise band. Also **1.18x llama.cpp's
  prefill** on the same GGUF file (denominator SUPERSEDED, see below), and **ahead of MLX-LM on
  prefill** on Apple Silicon. Most other architectures are speed-pending, and say so.
- **Everything.** 37 registered architectures, 36 tool-parser families, structured output including
  GBNF, three speculative decoders, image and video and audio input, external KV offload, Prometheus
  metrics, and the SGLang knobs, all in a library you can `dlopen`.

## Performance

Qwen3.6-27B (NVFP4) on NVIDIA GB10, greedy, closed loop, against the vLLM oracle in its
**production graphed config** (not `--enforce-eager`). Output is token-for-token identical at every
point on this curve:

| Concurrency | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **vllm.cpp** (tok/s) | **86.05** | **159.68** | **292.34** | **508.77** | **801.76** | **1095.01** |
| vLLM (tok/s) | 82.32 | 158.03 | 290.31 | 505.46 | 789.16 | 1076.25 |
| **Ratio** | **1.045x** | **1.011x** | **1.007x** | **1.007x** | **1.016x** | **1.017x** |

We are ahead at all six, but only c1 at 4.5% is clearly outside our 0.5% run-to-run noise band, so
treat c2 through c32 as ties. The tokens are identical either way, and the install is 66 MiB against
9.1 GiB.

Cold start to first `/health`: **36.5 s vs vLLM's 221.5 s (6.1x)**, provisional
([detail](.agents/benchmark-record.md)).

Peak host memory is a clean win at **24.88 GiB vs vLLM's 28.18 GiB**, with no Python stack behind it:

![What you install: a 9.1 GiB venv, or one 66 MiB binary](benchmarks/media/footprint.png)

And we hold every other engine to the same treatment: same model, same workload, same box.


### vs llama.cpp, on CPU, from the same GGUF file

| | vllm.cpp | llama.cpp | ratio |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| prefill | **223.8 tok/s** | 177.3 | **1.18x** |
| decode | 24.7 tok/s | 25.4 | 0.97x (tie) |
| peak memory | 2.83 GiB | 2.80 GiB | 1.01x |

Decode lands inside llama.cpp's own spread, and the memory gap is 30 MiB. Tokens are
**byte-identical to llama.cpp's greedy decode**. Single-stream only: concurrent serving against
llama.cpp's server is unmeasured.

> **Every llama.cpp denominator here is SUPERSEDED**: they came from `237ad9b96`, our own local-only
> fork, 65 performance commits deep. The pin is now stock `b10451` and each figure is owed a re-take
> that can move it either way ([#1003](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1003)).

### vs MLX-LM, on Apple M4, warm b=1

| | vllm.cpp | MLX-LM | ratio |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| prefill TTFT | **524.5 ms** | 532.6 ms | **1.5% ahead** |
| decode | 27.23 tok/s | 27.85 | 97.8% |
| warm total | 24.37 tok/s | 24.96 | **97.6%** |

That 2.4% is a real gap, not run-to-run noise: across 6 interleaved runs our spread was 0.12% and
MLX-LM's 0.34%. All of it sits in decode, 0.81 ms per token, and we know where it goes. Prefill is
ahead.

Under the hood on Metal: our GEMM runs at **97% of MLX's own** (3.91 TFLOP/s mma issue rate), the
decode GEMV streams weights at **83% of the part's memory-bandwidth peak**, and moving prefill
attention onto the matrix units was worth **4.3x**. Indicative rather than binding: two models
(OPT-125m, Qwen3-0.6B), 18 of 75 ops native, and the 97.6% needs the optional MLX GEMM provider
shape-gated to prefill (95.9% on the default build).

### Speculative decoding

MTP is **token-identical to vLLM's MTP and about 4% faster** at c1 on Qwen3.6-27B-NVFP4, on both gate
models end to end. Block-diffusion DFlash runs about 2x over spec-off but stays below vLLM's
throughput. That gap is an open bf16 acceptance floor, tracked in the benchmark record.

Full per-axis grids, memory tables, the nine residual axes, and exact reproduction recipes:
[docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md). The two figures above are rendered from these measured
numbers by [`benchmarks/demo/`](benchmarks/demo/), which reads its values from a committed spec, so
every figure traces back to the run that produced it.

> **Pre-release, under heavy development.** Correctness is gated token-for-token against a pinned
> vLLM oracle across 27 gated architectures. Speed is proven on one GPU (GB10, sm_121a) plus a CPU
> path that matches or beats llama.cpp on GGUF, against a SUPERSEDED fork denominator (#1003).
> Every capability is labelled honestly in [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).

## Quickstart

Start at **[docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)**. It runs one model from one command, with
no build and no checkpoint of your own: a container lane, the `curl` that answers it, the release
archive for a host without Docker, and the cache, token, and offline notes. `--model` accepts a
directory, a `.gguf` file, `org/repo`, or `org/repo:TAG`, and fetches what your cache lacks.

Full CLI, server, and library reference: [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md) and
[docs/reference/](docs/reference/README.md). CUDA, Metal, Vulkan, and every CMake option:
[docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).

## Features: vLLM parity, then everything else

vllm.cpp **mirrors vLLM by default**: same scheduler, same sampling order, same flags, same JSON
configs, token-for-token the same output. Switching to it should be boring. Everything below is what
you get on top, most of it borrowed from whichever engine does it best:

- **One 66 MiB binary instead of a 9.1 GiB install.** A flat, exception-free, llama.cpp-style C ABI
  ([`include/vllm.h`](include/vllm.h), ABI v19, 36 functions) for C, C++, Go, or Rust. No Python
  interpreter in the process.
- **GGUF as a first-class citizen.** Load the same quantized files llama.cpp uses, and on CPU
  **compute directly on the compressed blocks** (Q4_0/Q8_0/Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K) with no BF16
  expansion. Byte-identical greedy output to llama.cpp.
- **SGLang's good ideas, as documented toggles.** RadixAttention / prefix caching, LPM cache-aware
  scheduling, jump-forward decoding, and custom logits processors, opt-in from the library, the C
  ABI, or server flags. Each defaults to today's behavior, so an engine that sets none of them is
  byte-identical to one built without them ([docs/SGLANG-COMPAT.md](docs/SGLANG-COMPAT.md)).
- **Runs on hardware people actually have.** CUDA, CPU, Metal, and Vulkan ship from one tree. ROCm
  and Tenstorrent are growing; Apple MLX and Arm i8mm providers cover their useful shapes.
- **Speculative decoding beyond ngram.** MTP, block-diffusion DFlash, and draft-free ngram, through
  the same `--speculative-config` JSON vLLM takes
  ([docs/SPECULATIVE-DECODING.md](docs/SPECULATIVE-DECODING.md)).
- **Additive by design.** New architectures and new GPU targets land as additive files mirroring
  vLLM's own structure, so upstream changes port mechanically and a contribution stays a small diff.
- **Honest numbers.** Every capability is labelled correctness-complete, speed-pending, build-only,
  or hardware-blocked, and the evidence is in the record. Nothing is called fast that was not
  measured against a reference.

<details>
<summary><b>The full feature surface</b> (serving core, sampling, structured output, tool calling, multimodal, external KV)</summary>

- **vLLM's serving core.** Continuous batching, block-paged KV cache, automatic prefix caching (on
  by default for dense models), and the V1 / Model Runner V2 scheduler and engine step loop.
- **Sampling.** Greedy, temperature, top-k/p, min-p, presence/frequency/repetition penalties, seed,
  stop sequences, `logit_bias`, `allowed_token_ids`, and `bad_words`, in vLLM's exact order, plus
  sample logprobs.
- **Structured output.** JSON schema, JSON object, regex, choice, and GBNF grammar, enforced in the
  engine with a per-step logits bitmask.
- **Tool calling and reasoning.** 36 tool-parser families (40 accepted names) and 12 reasoning
  parser names, streaming, selectable with `--tool-call-parser` / `--reasoning-parser`. Chat templates
  render through the vendored google/minja engine, the same renderer llama.cpp ships.
- **Multimodal.** Image, video, and audio to text, correctness-complete. Image chat requests are
  wired through the OpenAI server (content parts on `/v1/chat/completions`) into the engine's
  registered forward; video and audio still run on the single-sequence path.
- **Quantization.** NVFP4 W4A4/W4A16, compressed-tensors NVFP4A16, GGUF
  F32/F16/Q4_0/Q8_0/Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K, and an FP8 W8A8 slice.
- **External KV.** KV offload to CPU/disk and an `lm://` LMCache client, plus KV-cache events for
  external routers. Opt-in, off by default ([docs/KV-OFFLOAD.md](docs/KV-OFFLOAD.md)).
- **Observability.** Prometheus `/metrics` with vLLM's metric names, `/server_info`, `/tokenize`,
  `/detokenize`, and `/reset_prefix_cache`.

## Supported models

Every architecture below passes a token-for-token correctness gate against the pinned vLLM oracle on
GB10. Where vLLM's own greedy is deterministic the bar is strict token-exact; where vLLM is
self-inconsistent at bf16 near-ties, the bar is a near-tie-robust check. "Speed" is a separate bar
(match or beat vLLM on every axis).

**Gate models:** Qwen3.6-27B and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (hybrid GDN + MoE, NVFP4), both token-exact, the
27B at or above vLLM throughput on every axis. **Also running:** Llama-3.x, Mistral, Qwen3/Qwen2
dense and MoE, DeepSeek-V2 and V4-Flash (MLA), GLM-4 and GLM-4.7-Flash, Laguna-S/XS-2.1,
Kimi-Linear-48B, Gemma-1 through Gemma-4, Phi-1 through Phi-4, OLMo-2, Granite-3, StableLM,
InternLM2/3, MiniCPM and MiniCPM3, Yi, OPT, plus Qwen3-VL and Qwen3.6-27B vision (image + video)
and Voxtral (audio).

Per-arch build flags, per-op coverage, and the quantization format table:
[docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).

## Build

CMake (>= 3.24) and a C++20 compiler. The core has no ML dependencies, and the tree builds
-Werror-clean on gcc 14.2.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j   # CPU: the correctness / CI reference
ctest --test-dir build
```

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-cuda -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON   # NVIDIA GB10
cmake --build build-cuda -j
```

Triton-AOT cubins for the fast GDN path are vendored, so Python and Triton are needed only to
regenerate them, never to build or run them; a CUDA build ships them. Metal is auto-detected on
Apple hosts; Vulkan is opt-in with `-DVLLM_CPP_VULKAN=ON`. Every CMake option, per-backend recipe,
and the quantization format table: [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).

## Running inference (CLI)

```sh
build/examples/vllm-cli --model /path/to/Qwen3.6-27B --prompt "The capital of France is" --max-tokens 64
```

`vllm-bench` (throughput/latency harness) and `tokenize` (tokenizer smoke tool) ship alongside it.
All flags, including `--speculative-config`: [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

### Multimodal INPUT and video GENERATION

Multimodal INPUT goes through `/v1/chat/completions` content parts (`image_url`,
`video_url`, `input_audio`). Video GENERATION:

```sh
build/examples/minimax-h3-gen --dit MiniMax-H3-FL2VA-Q4_K_M.gguf --dequant-bf16 \
  --encoder qwen3vl-32B-MiniMax-H3-Q4_K_M.gguf --tokenizer tokenizer.json \
  --video-vae video_vae.safetensors --audio-vae audio_vae.safetensors \
  --prompt "A golden retriever runs across a sunlit beach" \
  --frames 124 --height 480 --width 864 --steps 50 --device cuda --out out.mp4
```

Weights: [realrebelai/MiniMax-H3_GGUFs](https://huggingface.co/realrebelai/MiniMax-H3_GGUFs)
(DiT + encoder) and [MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-H3) (VAEs,
tokenizer). For SPEECH put the spoken line in the prompt. Recipe: [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## OpenAI-compatible server

```sh
build/examples/server --model /path/to/Qwen3.6-27B --port 8000 --max-num-seqs 32
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="not-needed")
print(client.completions.create(model="Qwen3.6-27B",
                                prompt="The capital of France is",
                                max_tokens=64).choices[0].text)
```

For a production deployment, use [LocalAI](https://localai.io), which can embed engines like this
behind a model gallery, multi-model serving, the full OpenAI API surface, auth, and metrics.

## Use it as a library (C API)

Link `libvllm` and include [`include/vllm.h`](include/vllm.h): a flat, exception-free,
llama.cpp-style C ABI (`VLLM_ABI_VERSION 19`, 36 exported functions) suitable for `dlopen` / FFI.

```c
vllm_model_params mp = vllm_model_params_default();
mp.model_path = "/path/to/model";

vllm_engine *engine = NULL;
if (vllm_engine_load(&mp, &engine) != VLLM_OK) { fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", vllm_last_error()); return 1; }

vllm_sampling_params sp = vllm_sampling_params_default();
sp.max_tokens = 64;               /* sp.temperature = 0.0 means greedy */

vllm_completion out;
if (vllm_complete(engine, "The capital of France is", &sp, &out) == VLLM_OK) {
    printf("%s\n", out.text);
    vllm_completion_free(&out);
}
vllm_engine_free(engine);
```

Structured output, chat with tools, tool and reasoning parser selection, speculative decoding,
prefix caching, custom logits processors, and engine sizing all have ABI surface. C++ consumers get
`LoadedEngine::FromModelDir(...)` handing back the same `LLMEngine` / `AsyncLLM` the server uses.
Both surfaces: [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Why vllm.cpp

Every engine today makes you give something up. vLLM has the best serving core in the business, but
running it drags in a heavy Python / PyTorch / CUDA stack and assumes a datacenter. llama.cpp is
wonderfully light and runs anywhere, but it is built around one user at a time. SGLang has scheduling
ideas nobody else ships. MLX is excellent, and only on a Mac.

We do not think you should have to choose. vllm.cpp is the attempt to have all of it in one place:
**real continuous batching and paged KV, in a 66 MiB library, on the hardware you already own, with
the features the community keeps asking for, and none of the Python.** Where another engine has
solved something better, we port from it and cite the file we ported from rather than inventing our
own version.

What makes that checkable is the gate. A new architecture is not "done" here when it produces
plausible text; it is done when it emits **the same tokens as vLLM**, and it is not "fast" until it is
measured against the reference in that reference's own production configuration. When we fall short,
the number stays in the README and the label says *speed-pending*.

## Credits, and what we borrow

vllm.cpp exists because other people built excellent engines first. Every implementation here is
grounded in upstream source and cites the file it was ported from, so this is where the work comes
from:

- **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)** is the reference this project is measured against
  and the origin of the serving core: continuous batching, block-paged KV, the V1 scheduler, sampling
  order, speculative decoding. It is also the oracle: every architecture here has to emit the same
  tokens vLLM does before it counts as working.
- **[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang)** contributed serving ideas nobody else ships,
  which we carry as documented toggles: RadixAttention, LPM cache-aware scheduling, and jump-forward
  decoding ([docs/SGLANG-COMPAT.md](docs/SGLANG-COMPAT.md)).
- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)** set the deployment standard we copied
  outright: one library, a flat C ABI, quantized weights straight off the shelf, and the vendored
  google/minja chat-template renderer it also ships. It is our CPU speed bar, and the reason GGUF is a
  first-class input here.
- **[MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx)** is the Apple Silicon bar, and optionally the GEMM
  provider on that path.
- Kernel work is ported from **CUTLASS**, **FlashInfer**, **Marlin**, and **TRT-LLM** rather than
  reinvented, cited per kernel in the porting inventory.

**A note on ggml:** vllm.cpp does not use ggml. It reads GGUF and follows llama.cpp's C ABI style, but
tensors, kernels, and dispatch are its own portable `vt::` runtime
([`include/vt/`](include/vt/)) with no ggml or PyTorch dependency at any point. ggml is a superb piece of engineering and llama.cpp
built the ecosystem this project plugs into; we needed a different tensor layer, that is all.
