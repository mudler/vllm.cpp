# vllm.cpp

A 1:1 port of [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) to pure C++ — no
Python, PyTorch, or ggml at runtime. The project mirrors vLLM's V1 / Model
Runner V2 architecture and exposes a library, C API, example CLI, and
OpenAI-compatible server.

> ⚠️ **Pre-release, under heavy development.** The text paths for
> **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** and **Qwen3.6-27B** pass token-exact greedy correctness
> gates on NVIDIA GB10. Production performance parity is still open: the
> binding 27B comparison against vLLM v0.25.0 passes **55/124** required axes.
> The latest W3-H DGX trace (`b8c8086`) is **VOID**: its first model report
> passes schema-v5 exact reconciliation, but the secondary kernel-summary path
> omitted the model contract and failed closed before sessions 2/3 or vLLM.
> That integration bug is repaired and CPU-green; a fresh immutable 12-report
> DGX gate is pending. No W3-H speed credit or 35B performance result is
> claimed. See
> [Benchmarks](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for the exact checkpoint.

## Current status

| Gate | State | Current evidence | Next gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B correctness | ✅ PASS | Real NVFP4 model, token-exact greedy oracle | Retained as the precondition for every performance run |
| Qwen3.6-27B performance | ❌ FAILED / `GATING` | Immutable `3f256ab`: **55/124 pass, 69 fail** against vLLM v0.25.0 | Finish the repaired W3-H trace, gate the selected repair, then rerun all 124 axes |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B correctness | ✅ PASS | Real NVFP4 safetensors and supported GGUF text paths | Continue no-regression checks |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B performance | ⏸ BLOCKED | No current v0.25.0 performance result | Run only after all 27B axes pass |
| W3-H normal BF16→FP4 producer | 🚧 `ACTIVE` / trace-first | `b8c8086` passes build, 27B correctness, plans, clients, shutdown, and report-1 schema-v5 reconciliation, then fails in the secondary summary because its model key was not forwarded. The repair and regression contracts are CPU-green | Execute a fresh immutable 12-report DGX trace; W3-H2 stays prohibited until all reports and the paired vLLM arm pass |

The binding cache-off workload is input 1,024 → output 128, greedy, closed
loop, with three interleaved repetitions. Ratios are direction-normalized so
**1.0 or higher passes**.

| Concurrency | Axes passing | Total throughput: ours / vLLM | Ratio |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 5/20 | 81.645 / 82.179 tok/s | **0.993504×** |
| 2 | 4/20 | 150.561 / 157.744 tok/s | **0.954464×** |
| 4 | 5/20 | 280.291 / 290.025 tok/s | **0.966438×** |
| 8 | 4/20 | 495.700 / 505.466 tok/s | **0.980678×** |
| 16 | 17/20 | 812.303 / 790.264 tok/s | **1.027889×** |
| 32 | 18/20 | 1121.955 / 1079.407 tok/s | **1.039417×** |

Total throughput beats vLLM at c16/c32, but parity requires every throughput,
latency, and memory axis to pass. Host PSS/RSS remain large open gaps; sampled
GPU memory and available-memory drop pass. The full per-axis table and exact
reproduction recipe are in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

### Current performance track

| Work item | Present disposition |
|---|---|
| Frozen 64-plan NVFP4 tactic map | Control gate passes; all component comparisons use the same vLLM v0.25.0 plan map |
| Packed full-attention QKV | Structural target closed at **208.192 vs 208** FP4 GEMMs/forward; retained, but its isolated strict component did not pass every axis |
| Direct swizzled activation scales | Correctness and trace pass; component **FAILED** at 39/40 timing + 1/8 memory axes, so no independent speed credit |
| Model-owned device alpha | Correctness and trace pass; component **FAILED** at 27/40 timing + 3/8 memory axes, so no independent speed credit |
| FA2 ratio-6 split-KV decode | Correctness and structural dispatch pass; component **FAILED** at 35/40 timing + 5/8 memory axes despite positive mean throughput |
| Vectorized normal BF16→FP4 I/O | Not implemented. A complete repaired W3-H1d trace is the active prerequisite |

## What is implemented

The implemented subset is intentionally narrower than vLLM's full feature
surface.

| Area | Implemented scope |
|---|---|
| Engine | V1 scheduler, unified token budget, chunked prefill, FCFS preemption, persistent input batch, engine step loop, and batched generation |
| KV cache | Block-paged full-attention KV, hybrid full-attention + GDN state groups, prefix-cache manager, allocation/recycling, and device-resident gate-model state |
| Models | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B and Qwen3.6-27B text forwards with GDN, full attention, dense/MoE layers, and paged generation |
| Loading | Safetensors for both gate models; supported 35B GGUF k-quant files materialized to BF16 |
| Sampling | Greedy, temperature, top-k, top-p, min-p, repetition/frequency/presence penalties, allowed-token and bad-word masks, and internal logprob primitives |
| Serving | Basic `/v1/completions` and `/v1/chat/completions`, non-streaming and incremental SSE, concurrent scheduling, cancellation, usage frames, models/health/version endpoints |
| Structured output | Bounded JSON schema, JSON object, regex, choice, GBNF, and Hermes-style tool-call subset |
| Library | Shared/static `libvllm`, stable 17-symbol C ABI, blocking and nonblocking request lifecycles, example CLI, and OpenAI server |

Behavioral CPU tests run under CTest. CUDA correctness, sanitizer, trace, and
performance evidence is recorded per feature rather than inferred from source.

## Quick start

```sh
# CPU build. Add -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON on NVIDIA and
# -DVLLM_CPP_SERVER=ON for the HTTP server.
cmake -S . -B build -DVLLM_CPP_SERVER=ON
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build

# GB10 fast-GDN build. Triton-AOT cubins are vendored; Python/Triton is only
# needed to regenerate them, not to build or run them.
cmake -S . -B build-cuda \
  -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON \
  -DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=ON \
  -DVLLM_CPP_SERVER=ON
cmake --build build-cuda -j

# Serve a supported Qwen text checkpoint.
./build-cuda/examples/server \
  --model /path/to/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B \
  --port 8000 \
  --max-num-seqs 32 \
  --max-num-batched-tokens 8192

# One-shot completion through the C ABI.
./build-cuda/examples/vllm-cli \
  --model /path/to/model \
  --prompt "The capital of France is"
```

Link `libvllm` or load it dynamically and use `include/vllm.h`.
`vllm_complete` / `vllm_complete_stream` provide blocking calls;
`vllm_request_submit` and the request lifecycle functions provide nonblocking
concurrent streams.

## Supported model architectures

| Architecture | Families | Safetensors | GGUF | Status |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Qwen3.5/3.6 hybrid text | Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, Qwen3.6-27B | ✅ | 35B only | 🟡 Token-exact correctness passes on GB10; 27B performance is `GATING` at 55/124 axes; vision paths are not implemented |
| Qwen3 / Qwen2 dense | Qwen3-32B, Qwen3-0.6B, … | — | — | 🗓 Post-parity roadmap |
| Llama-family dense | Llama 3.x, Mistral | — | — | 🗓 Post-parity roadmap |
| MoE decoders | Mixtral, Qwen3-MoE | — | — | 🗓 Post-parity roadmap |

## Acceleration

| Backend | Hardware | Status |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | x86-64 reference | 🟡 Correctness/CI implementation with native threadpool; real-file GGUF speed/RSS and compute-in-quant gates remain open |
| CUDA | GB10 / DGX Spark, sm_121a | 🟡 Gate-model correctness passes; 27B v0.25.0 performance remains `GATING` at 55/124; the schema-v5 summary integration repair is CPU-green and a fresh DGX trace is pending |
| Other NVIDIA SMs | sm70 through sm120 families inventoried from vLLM | 🗓 Not yet fully built, traced, or gated here |
| ROCm / Intel XPU | AMD / Intel GPUs | 🗓 Post-parity roadmap |
| Metal / ANE | Apple Silicon | 🗓 Post-parity roadmap; M4 bring-up host available |
| Vulkan | Portable GPU | 🗓 Post-parity roadmap |

Only GB10/sm_121a counts as CUDA hardware support today. Source-level fallback
paths do not become support claims until their build, correctness, trace, and
performance gates pass.

### Kernel coverage on the gate path

| Kernel family | CPU | CUDA · GB10 | Status |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Dense NVFP4 W4A4 GEMM | ✅ ref | ✅ | CUTLASS/FlashInfer-compatible tactics, frozen plan cache, packed QKV |
| MoE NVFP4 W4A16 GEMM | ✅ ref | ✅ | Marlin/fp4-resident gate path |
| BF16/FP8 projection GEMM | ✅ ref | ✅ | cuBLASLt TN / `nvjet_sm121` path |
| Prefill attention | ✅ ref | ✅ | Vendored FlashAttention-2 with portable fallback |
| Paged decode attention | ✅ ref | 🟡 | FA2 ratio-6 route is correctness/structure-green but strict performance-failed |
| GDN / linear attention | ✅ ref | ✅ | Vendored Triton-AOT and tensor-core WY gate path |
| RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, FP4/FP8 quant | ✅ ref | ✅ | Gate-path coverage; broader variant inventory remains open |
| CUDA-graph decode | — | 🟡 | Gate-model path runs; complete cross-model evidence remains open |

## Quantization

| Format | Status |
|---|---|
| NVFP4 W4A4 / W4A16 | 🟡 Both gate-model paths run on GB10 and pass token-exact correctness. The current 27B performance gate fails 69/124 axes; `b8c8086` is void on a repaired trace-summary integration bug and no speed credit is claimed |
| GGUF F32, Q4_0, Q8_0, Q3_K/Q4_K/Q5_K/Q6_K | 🟡 Supported 35B files load through BF16 materialization and pass same-file llama.cpp greedy checks; direct compute-in-quant and several formats remain open |
| FP8 | 🟡 The 35B ModelOpt static per-tensor W8A8 projection slice is implemented; generic FP8 modes and FP8 KV remain open |
| MXFP4 / MXFP8 | 🗓 Planned, including MLX-native modes |

Legend: ✅ supported and tested · 🟡 partial / gating · 🗓 planned.

## Serving and API caveats

- The Qwen3.6 checkpoints' shipped tool template uses Qwen3-Coder XML and
  forced reasoning blocks. The current Hermes-style parser does not yet fully
  implement that format.
- `/health` currently reports process liveness rather than a full engine-health
  probe.
- Prefix caching is configurable and mirrors the supported default policy, but
  the binding SGLang/vLLM shared-prefix competitor gate is still pending.
- External KV-cache connectors, including LMCache interoperability, are
  roadmap-only and are not implemented or benchmarked yet.
- Speculative decoding is not user-visible yet. MTP foundations exist, while
  MTP integration, DFlash, DSpark, TLI, n-gram, and EAGLE3 remain roadmap work.
- Multimodal/vision, LoRA, multi-GPU, local attention model consumers, and
  scaled long-context RoPE consumers are not supported yet.

The next execution order is fixed: repaired, complete W3-H trace → selected component
gate → all-axis 27B parity → 35B parity → the SGLang shared-prefix gate → the
rest of [roadmap v1](.agents/roadmap_v1.md), including DSpark and external KV
cache / LMCache support.
