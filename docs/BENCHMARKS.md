# Benchmarks

## At a glance: W5/W6 green; validated release artifacts pending

| Reference | Workload | Headline | Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weight load (`ENG-LOAD-DIRECT-UPLOAD`, #150)** | Qwen3.6-27B bf16 (50.098 GiB), GB10 Vulkan, same binary both arms, interleaved under one GPU lock | **Load phase 1.54x warm** (19.27 -> 12.48 s), **1.61x cold** (52.62 -> 32.75 s); bytes moved **100.196 -> 81.260 GiB**. Every ON leg beat every OFF leg | byte-identical; 6/6 token-exact |
| **Structured state record (active)** | v1 scalar + relational + Git-history contracts | No benchmark. At `776c56f1`: 157 imports = 3,231,342 exact bytes; append preserved all 156 wrappers/rows. 95 tests: validator/core 44 (checker 20 + core 24), NOW 18, migration 22, cutover 11. New raw-row mutation guard. | n/a |

| **Binary release delivery topology** | #196: read-only build/verify, OIDC attest, protected publish; generated indexes and explicit handoff-authenticated assets | Fixes the zero-binary release path by attaching all eight archive/checksum/provenance triplets plus indexes. Hosted proof pending; W12 diagnostics optional | n/a |

| **LoRA runtime W2** (`LORA-RUNTIME`, #278) | **No number owed:** correctness-only; a grid PENDS the W7 model gate |
| **ARCH audit: ABI is text-only** | 4 capabilities (H3 video, Laguna, Kimi-Linear, DeepSeek-V4) reachable only from `examples/`, none registry-backed. No gate asks whether a CONSUMER can reach a capability. Documentation only |
| **DSR fix: server TU profiler guards (2026-08-09)** | **No number owed:** comments only. #189 moved the server body into the shared layer with its 5 `VT_BENCH_PROFILE_CONTROL` guards, taking DSR 32 -> 37; they are `DSR-ALLOW`'d per site, baseline unchanged at 32 |
| **DSR fix: async readback capability (2026-08-08)** | **No number owed**: behavior-neutral (CPU/CUDA async-ON, discrete non-CUDA async-OFF, unchanged); moves a `kCUDA` check onto `Backend`, unblocking red CI on #127/#154/#155 |

Reading the ratios: throughput is ours/reference, latency is reference/ours, so
**1.0 or higher is a win** everywhere on this page. Which architecture each number
is measured on, and the per-architecture correctness gate behind it, is the
registry-bound list in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

## vLLM, online serving

The binding comparison. vLLM runs its **production graphed config**, never
`--enforce-eager`, because the graphed config is the honest denominator.

| Model | Quant | vLLM pin | Axes passing | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B | NVFP4 (`unsloth` @`890bdef7`) | 0.25.0 | **115/124** | Effective parity-or-better, two-grid totality. Revision-PINNED (the gate no longer lets `readdir` choose): @`ccdaab7e` is the same repo name re-quantized to FP8 W8A8 throughout, not NVFP4 |
| Qwen3.6-27B | NVFP4 (`nvidia` @`0893e160`, ModelOpt `modelopt_mixed`) | 0.25.0 | 0/4 | **BEHIND, uniformly 0.85x** on decode throughput (was 0.72x before the FP8 tower fix); greedy continuation IDENTICAL to vLLM. A different model from the `unsloth` row (NVFP4 MLP + FP8 W8A8 GDN/attn tower) |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | NVFP4 `modelopt_mixed` | 0.25.0 | 2/18 | 3-rep grid 2026-08-05 @`1ea26427`: 0.93-1.03x (c4 wins), c16 0.93x. Both c16 levers A/B'd NEG: drain event -1.9%, mirror 0.999x. ★ probe found a prod async batch-1 greedy DEGENERATION bug the mirror fixes |

### Qwen3.6-27B by concurrency

Medians of three interleaved repetitions, 1,024 in / 128 out, cache off, closed
loop. Output is token-for-token identical to vLLM at every point. The `nvidia`
ModelOpt table that follows is a DIFFERENT checkpoint on a DIFFERENT axis and
must not be compared against this one: a 7-token prompt scored on OUTPUT tokens
per second, with method, attribution and the owed 1,024 in / 128 out axis in
[the benchmark record](../.agents/benchmark-record.md).

| Concurrency | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **vllm.cpp** TOTAL tok/s | **86.05** | 159.68 | 292.34 | 508.77 | 801.76 | 1095.01 |
| vLLM TOTAL tok/s | 82.32 | 158.03 | 290.31 | 505.46 | 789.16 | 1076.25 |
| **Ratio** | **1.045x** | 1.011x | 1.007x | 1.007x | 1.016x | 1.017x |
| Axes passing | 20/20 | 20/20 | 18/20 | 15/20 | 19/20 | 18/20 |

TOTAL tokens per second (prompt plus output), not a decode rate: c1's 86.05 is
about 10 tok/s of decode plus about 940 of prefill. The `nvidia` table below
counts OUTPUT only, hence its c1 of 10.41.
We are nominally ahead at all six, but only c1 means anything. Our run-to-run
noise band is 0.5% and c2 through c32 land between 0.7% and 1.7%, so **treat
those five as ties**, not as wins. The nine axes that fail in both grids are one
tradeoff, not nine problems: our synchronous deterministic forward loses on
low-concurrency *median* decode and TTFT, and wins the corresponding *tail* and
the same metric at higher concurrency (c8 p99 ITL 0.86x, but 1.055x at c16 and
1.078x at c32).

| Tokens | greedy continuation IDENTICAL between engines, captured from the same warm processes as these numbers | | | |
| Reading | still a real loss, not a tie, and still FLAT across the sweep, so batching and the scheduler are not the cause | | | |

### Qwen3.6-35B-A3B by concurrency

| Concurrency | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **vllm.cpp** tok/s | 65.6 | 93.6 | 142.9 | 197.6 | 256.2 | 323.1 |
| vLLM tok/s | 67.0 | 99.9 | 150.6 | 211.3 | 272.9 | 333.6 |

| vLLM CoV | 0.62% | 0.35% | 0.81% | 0.57% | 0.50% | 0.35% |

**There is no isolated c2/c8 weakness.** Binding grid at `a0fa12c7`
(2026-08-10), 3 reps, binding-eligible 12/12; the prior c2 0.87x / c8 0.92x
"weak cells" came from a different harness and were never comparable. The
deficit is a flat mid-band (c2 to c16 within 0.935x-0.949x, CoV under 0.81% on
both engines) and is entirely MARGINAL per-token work, since our FIXED per-step
cost already beats vLLM (9.02 ms against 9.43 ms). Two glue levers land against
it, both default ON: the fused shared-expert gate_up sink off the MoE-marlin
route (**+1.31% c8 / +1.38% c4**, `VT_MARLIN_DENSE_PAIR`) and the shared
`down_proj` emitted as bf16 rather than f32 (**+2.05% c8 / +0.79% c4**,
bit-identical, `VT_SHARED_DOWN_BF16`).

The SiLU lever is NEGATIVE ([spec](../.agents/specs/moe-silu-vectorize.md)):
the 9.2x per-launch gap that motivated it was a MEAN over a bimodal kernel
(min 1.34 us, max 979 us) and our decode-phase SiLU is already faster than
vLLM's, so the remaining band is unattributed. The
marlin block-size lever is REFUTED (block 8 at c8 is 1.16% SLOWER against a
+0.29% control), and a per-launch marlin gap is WITHDRAWN as cross-tool
uncertainty. Memory passes decisively: peak PSS **3.81x**, peak GPU **1.40x**.
Detail in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`.

**Device-resident sampled tokens on integrated (`VT_ASYNC_DEVICE_MIRROR`) A/B'd
2026-08-06, speed-NEUTRAL** (same-binary): c16 OFF median 2305.8 vs ON 2303.3
(0.999x), c32 2928.9 vs 2919.1 (0.997x), bands overlap. It is a drain MOVE (relocate
the drain past the host prep, not remove it), so it overlaps only the small host
prep; the drain still serializes GPU input staging, so c16 does not recover. The
drain REMOVAL, `VT_ASYNC_EXECUTOR` Option A (`row/SERVE-ASYNC-OPTION-A`, default-OFF,
input H2D staged out of capture, the faithful vLLM structure), is GREEN + RED-reproducing
but binding-A/B speed-NEUTRAL (c8/c16/c32 +0.0-0.1%), so the c16 gap is NOT the async
input path. Detail in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`.

**But the mirror FIXES a shipping correctness bug, so it is now DEFAULT ON
(ROW-SERVE-ASYNC-LLM, 2026-08-06).** Baseline async (AsyncLLM depth-2) batch-1 greedy
decode degenerated into nondeterministic token-0 garbage; the mirror is deterministic
and coherent. The missing gate now exists, `test_qwen36_async_serving` (depth-2
AsyncLLM, batch-1 + concurrency, token-exact vs the SACRED oracle): RED on `=0`, GREEN
on the default. c16 re-checked on the default: 2312.9/2303.9/2294.4 (median
**2303.9**), c32 2942.7 (no regression). Root cause + file:line in the benchmark
record. The same P0 hit classic dense `Qwen3ForCausalLM` (quant-independent), fixed by `ROW-SERVE-ASYNC-DENSE-MIRROR` (see the MXFP4 Qwen3-8B row). The intake-drain lever likewise measured NEUTRAL (2026-08-06, `VT_INTAKE_DRAIN` A/B 3+3 reps): admitting during the forward wait collapses intake -91% but shifts it into queued, arrival-to-scheduled invariant, so the recorded INTAKE term is an attribution boundary over a GPU-bound prefill wait, not reducible; lever reverted, byte-exact `VT_LOOP_TRACE` probe kept.

### DeepSeek-V2-Lite (MLA)

Medians of 3 reps, 1,024 in / 128 out. The vLLM arm runs `--moe-backend triton`,
which is its best **stable** graphed config on GB10: the auto-selected FlashInfer
CUTLASS MoE backend hard-rebooted the box five times. The substitution does not
flatter us, we lose against it.

| Concurrency | Output tok/s ours / vLLM | Ratio | Median TTFT | Median TPOT |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 33.18 / 38.17 | 0.87x | 0.95x | 0.90x |
| 2 | 52.63 / 55.27 | 0.95x | 0.88x | **1.03x** |
| 4 | 70.36 / 81.51 | 0.86x | **1.04x** | 0.86x |
| 8 | 102.37 / 116.35 | 0.88x | **1.12x** | 0.86x |

Peak memory is the decisive win: **31.38 GiB against vLLM's 68.5 GiB**, with the
caveat that vLLM pre-reserves a fixed fraction up front while we allocate the KV
blocks the workload needs. Real difference in operating footprint, not evidence
of a lower per-token KV cost.

### Laguna-S-2.1 (NVFP4)

`poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4`, 118B total / ~8B active MoE, 48 layers,
256 experts, ~67 GiB. Both arms NVFP4, single request, batch 1, GB10. The local
checkpoint directory is named `laguna-xs-nvfp4`, which is where the "Laguna-XS"
label in earlier revisions of this page came from; the measured model is S-2.1.

| Arm | Decode tok/s | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|
| vLLM NVFP4, graphed | 43.10 | 1.00x |
| **vllm.cpp NVFP4**, resident decode + CUDA graph | **44.46** | **1.03x** |

The gap is CLOSED (2026-08-04, same-tool nsys graph-node tracing on both
engines). Root cause: the bf16 M=1 projection GEMVs (o_proj, qkv, router,
dense, lm_head) read their weights from GB10 UNIFIED/ATS host memory (a
`w.View()` device retag, no `cudaMalloc` staging), which the GPU reads slower
than true device memory. `VT_LAGUNA_RESIDENT_BF16W` (default-ON parity enabler)
stages every projection device-resident (one H2D copy at load); byte-exact
(ids bit-identical to the `=0` retag arm). Binding new-default decode is 44.46
tok/s (median-of-3), 1.03x vs vLLM's graphed 43.10.

Per-call the residency recovers o_proj 194 to 131 us (about 168 to 249 GB/s),
qkv 245 to 225 us, and lm_head 2410 to 1620 us/call. This supersedes the earlier
invocation / bf16-output-`cublasGemmEx` framing (measured a wash): the
invocation was never the cause, the weight's memory RESIDENCY was. Full
forensics in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`.

Memory: the roughly 2.6 GB of bf16 device copies sit in the 119 GB GB10 unified
pool; peak host RSS is unchanged at about 40.7 GiB (device/unified allocations
are not counted in `ru_maxrss`), so there is no memory regression.

## Memory

Qwen3.6-27B NVFP4, GB10, whole serving window.

| Axis | vllm.cpp | vLLM | Ratio | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Peak PSS | 24.88 GiB | 28.18 GiB | 1.133x | **PASS** |
| Peak RSS | 24.88 GiB | 28.56 GiB | 1.148x | **PASS** |
| Peak GPU memory | 40,996 MiB | 70,531 MiB | 1.720x | **PASS** |
| Peak `MemAvailable` drop | 68.35 GiB | 80.66 GiB | 1.180x | **PASS** |

35B steady-serving PSS is 3.53 GiB against vLLM's 13.3 GiB after the routed-expert
host mirror is freed once the device Marlin resident is built.

## llama.cpp, CPU

| RPi5/A76 arm (R4-R6, `GATING`) | Result |
|---|---|
| Scope | 4-core A76, DotProd, no i8mm; 20-core binding arm does NOT transfer. buildx/QEMU-built, Pi-executed unthrottled; hashes pinned in the [campaign spec](../.agents/specs/rpi5-cortex-a76-cpu-optimization.md) |
| Assembly vs compiler SDOT (one GCC 13.3 binary) | AAPCS64 leaf wall +3.66% M1/T1, +5.08% M128/T1, +3.69% M128/T4, with 9.74-10.24% fewer instructions; M1/T4 is the -2.43% residual ([assembly evidence](bench-evidence/rpi5-a76-q8-dot-20260806.md)) |
| 64-token Qwen model gate | Byte-identical across x86, portable, SDOT and assembly arms; asm vs SDOT median TTFT -1.55%, TPOT neutral, E2E -0.13%; vs portable TTFT -33.40%, E2E -2.67%. Cortex-A76+DotProd selects assembly by default |
| Same-file llama.cpp floor (pp17/tg64) | **NOT MET on speed**: prefill 12.81 vs 27.77 tok/s (0.461x), decode 2.55 vs 3.91 (0.653x), E2E 26,018.39 vs 16,998.49 ms ([competitor evidence](bench-evidence/rpi5-a76-llamacpp-20260806.md)) |
| Peak RSS | **2.841 vs 3.747 GiB, 24.2% less**; 3 clean unthrottled reps; same-text 64-token greedy output byte-identical after trailing-newline normalization |
| `PENDING` | Pi concurrency; BF16 GEMM / speed closure (the 2.17x prefill, 1.53x decode gap profiling is W6) |

Same GGUF file both arms, `dgx.casa` GB10 aarch64 (20 cores), idle, 3 reps,
llama.cpp `237ad9b96` built fresh on the same host.

| Axis | vllm.cpp | llama.cpp | Ratio | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Prefill | **223.8 tok/s** | 177.3 | **1.18x** | **PASS** |
| Decode | 24.7 tok/s | 25.4 | 0.97x | tie |
| Peak memory | 2.83 GiB | 2.80 GiB | 1.01x | **PARITY** |

Decode lands inside llama.cpp's own run-to-run spread, and the memory difference
is 30 MiB on a 2.8 GiB working set. Prefill is the only axis with a real gap and
it goes our way. Output tokens are **byte-identical** to llama.cpp's greedy
decode and to our own CPU reference path. Single-stream only: we have not
measured concurrent serving against llama.cpp's server.

## MLX-LM, Apple M4

Qwen3-0.6B, warm, batch 1, 6 interleaved runs.

| Axis | vllm.cpp | MLX-LM | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Prefill TTFT | **524.5 ms** | 532.6 ms | **1.015x** |
| Decode | 27.23 tok/s | 27.85 | 0.978x |
| Warm total | 24.37 tok/s | 24.96 | 0.976x |

The 2.4% is a real gap, not noise: our spread was 0.12% and MLX-LM's 0.34%. All
of it sits in decode, 0.81 ms per token. Indicative rather than binding: two
models, 18 of 75 ops native, and the 97.6% needs the optional MLX GEMM provider
shape-gated to prefill (95.9% on the default build).

## DwarfStar, GGUF

DeepSeek-V4-Flash cannot run on vLLM on a single GB10 at all: every
vLLM-loadable checkpoint is 156 GB or larger against a 119 GiB unified pool, so
the only quant that fits is extreme-low-bit GGUF, which vLLM cannot load here.
GGUF was forced by the hardware. A policy-correct vLLM comparison needs 2x GB10
Sparks with TP2 and is owed.

| Engine | Quant | Decode tok/s | Ratio |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| DwarfStar (`ds4`) | IQ2_XXS mixed | 16.33 | 1.00x |
| **vllm.cpp** (default) | same GGUF | **16.28** | **0.997x, parity** |
| **vllm.cpp** (`VT_V4_RESIDENT_W` default-ON) | same GGUF | **18.69** | **1.144x, byte-exact** |

The default arm is parity, measured same-session clean (2026-08-04, single-load
steady both arms); the earlier 15.87/96% and 17.13 figures are superseded.

Weight residency is the beat-path (2026-08-05, `VT_V4_RESIDENT_W`, default-ON). Env var allowlisted (env-doc gate green).
The dense Q8_0 MLA/shared-expert/lm_head projection tower is read from the GGUF
mmap over ATS/unified memory, which the GB10 GPU reads about 20% slower per-GEMV
than `cudaMalloc`'d device memory. Staging that ~6 GiB tower device-resident once
at load (same bytes, same kernel, same invocation) lifts decode 16.23 to 18.69
(median-of-3, drop_caches), generated ids byte-identical. It is the same lever
that took Laguna to vLLM parity+ (`VT_LAGUNA_RESIDENT_BF16W`).

PEAK RESIDENT is flat at 86.68 GiB in both arms: the staged copy is additive but
the clean mmap file pages evict under the unified pool, so net usage does not
grow. An nsys A/B (identical instance counts) confirms the mechanism is
residency-bound, not latency-bound: per-launch time drops about 20% on every
dense Q8_0 kernel (`QuantDotGemmQ8_0Kernel` 184 to 147 µs, `Q8_0GroupDiagKernel`
212 to 166 µs, `Q8_0PairKernel` 74 to 60 µs). This corrects the earlier
"per-launch GEMV parity / Q8_0 weight-stream floor" framing: our GEMV was
ATS-bound, not at ds4 parity.

Phase-2 staged the routed-expert slabs too (the ~70 GiB IQ2/Q2_K bulk,
`VT_V4_RESIDENT_EXPERTS`, first-touch `cudaMalloc` plus immediate
`madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` per slab so the transient stays ~flat). It was **measured
NEGATIVE (2026-08-05) and is HELD default-OFF** as a characterized artifact.
Same-binary median-of-3, warm-cancelled steady, drop_caches: OFF (Phase-1) **19.43
tok/s** vs ON **18.76 tok/s** (0.966x, ~3.4% slower), generated ids byte-identical
(md5 equal across all 6 runs), PEAK RESIDENT flat at 86.6 GiB. The move itself
works: host RSS drops 86 to 14 GiB as the mmap pages are reclaimed.

The regression matches the roofline. Unlike the dense Q8_0 tower (63% of DRAM
peak, bandwidth-bound), the grouped-MoE `QuantDotGemmGrouped<IQ2_XXS>`/`<Q2_K>`
kernels run at only ~19-24% of peak (dequant/latency-bound), so weight residency,
a bandwidth lever, cannot help them. It also adds a large one-time graph-capture
cost, and pinning the 70 GiB as `cudaMalloc` (vs evictable mmap file cache) cuts
the unified-pool reclaimable headroom from ~103 to ~30 GiB avail. The lever stays
in the tree, default-OFF, for reproducibility; detail in the benchmark record.

## Speculative decoding

| Speculator | Model | Result | Status |

| Breadth (EAGLE1/3, suffix, ngram-gpu, dynamic-k, ...) | n/a | enumerated from vLLM source + `INVENTORIED` 2026-08-06 (`.agents/specs/spec-decode-inventory.md`), unmeasured | `INVENTORIED` |

## How we measure


Record dates are CI-guarded: structured state event timestamps and ordered
indexes are validated by `check-state-record`, so scoreboard stamps remain
traceable. The
review protocol behind these numbers is guarded the same way: the reviewer and
implementer sub-agent prompts are tracked artifacts checked by
`check-protocol-consistency` (orchestration harness step 5/5), and
`check-gate-commands` pins the 25 record rows that name a gate command able to
FAIL. That pin is exact, not shrink-only: gaining a gate command reddens it too,
so the set is never re-pinned silently in either direction. Since 2026-08-07,
a PR verified green merges in that same session (disposition rule).

**Hardware.** NVIDIA GB10 / DGX Spark (sm_121a) for CUDA, `dgx.casa` aarch64 for
CPU, Apple M4 for Metal. GB10's 119 GiB pool is unified, so host and device
memory compete; end-to-end wall-clock on a cold page cache is unusable there,
and steady-state per-step timing or `nsys` GPU-busy is the anchor. The
2026-08-06 #77-slip tree-revert changed no benchmark content or number.

**Oracle pin.** vLLM 0.26.0.dev0 (`55596792`) plus transformers 5.14.1, built from
source for sm_121a. Speed figures labelled 0.25.0 are the last binding run; the
engine is unchanged by the pin advance and a 0.26 re-benchmark is pending.
Correctness re-validated bit-identical across the advance, zero golden drift.

**Protocol.** Greedy, closed loop, three interleaved repetitions per point, one
`flock` across the whole series, same-binary A/B for every lever, cold legs
discarded. Workload equivalence between arms is audited, not assumed: batch cap,
token budget, context, corpus bytes, KV and SSM dtypes, kernel family, and
graphed decode all match, and the audit is
[recorded](../.agents/specs/benchmark-equivalence-audit-2026-07-15.md). The
2026-08-04/08 governance checkpoints (record/CI substrate, anchor backfill,
operator/helper W0-W5, upstream/device inventory, onboarding probe, the
review-hardened `agent-start.py` entrypoint, and CI-bound review-until-PASS
policy) touched no engine code and moved no number: **NOT APPLICABLE**, nothing
to reproduce.

The PR #28 sanitizer repair is also NOT APPLICABLE to performance: both full
333-test CPU detector lanes pass after merging upstream `main`, while the
ASan+UBSan build footprint falls from 93 GiB to 5.7 GiB and TSan occupies
1.9 GiB. Reproduce with the sanitizer
CTest commands preserved in the structured state evidence. The 2026-08-06 live-state audit and the 2026-08-08 state-record migration plus range-gate and stale-reference repair are likewise NOT APPLICABLE: bookkeeping, record checkers, and prose. No engine code, kernel, or number on this page changed.

**Vocabulary.** *Token-exact* means our output ids equal the reference's, byte
for byte. *Near-tie* means the reference's own greedy decode is not deterministic
at this precision, so the gate is distributional: our output must fall inside the
set the reference produces across K runs. *Tie* means the difference is inside
the measured run-to-run noise band, which is 0.5% on GB10 and 0.12% to 0.34% on
M4. We never publish a partial, contended, or stale-denominator number as
binding, and when a denominator turns out to be wrong we correct every ratio
built on it rather than keeping the flattering one.

**CPU elementwise GEMM, wide x86 tiers (2026-08-07).** INDICATIVE ONLY, not binding: the x86 dev box is VOID for timing per `CLAIM-KERNEL-CPU-ELEM-GEMM-1`. The AVX-512 tier measures 1.56x to 2.83x over SSE2 on the elementwise micro-kernels, byte-identically. A binding number needs a qualified x86 host, which the project does not have.

**CPU elementwise GEMM, transpose-free `[K,N]` path (2026-08-07).** On dgx aarch64 the `[K,N]` path beats `[N,K]` by 1.16x to 1.30x, byte-identically. The x86 arm is INDICATIVE ONLY, not binding: that box is VOID for timing per `CLAIM-KERNEL-CPU-ELEM-GEMM-1`. `VT_CPU_MATMUL_STEAL` ships default OFF and is NOT measured; it must justify itself by measurement and may measure neutral.

Upstream ships this path explicitly unoptimized (`gpu_model_runner.py:5622-5623`); a step where no request asks is unchanged | Floor if one is ever wanted: vLLM's own `prompt_logprobs=k`, same model and prompt |
| `logprobs_mode` (`SAMPLE-LOGPROB-TOKEN-IDS`, #238) | **NO number measured, claimed or owed.** Correctness-only, CPU. One [n, vocab] device->host copy per step when a processed mode is engaged, nothing when not | Nothing to close: observation modes, not a path vLLM optimizes either |
| `logprob_token_ids` scoring (#264) | **No number owed:** correctness-only, CPU-gated; inert unless set | Owed once the OpenAI field is wired |
| SGLang floor arms | Never ran | Both arms of the SGLang comparison |
| Embeddings on the ONE surface (ROW 6, `LlamaModel` + `vllm_embed` + `/v1/embeddings`) | **NO number measured, claimed or owed.** Correctness-gated only, CPU: the 2026-08-08 fold (engine path == direct registry path, f64 LAST+normalize reference on the committed fixture) is plumbing, no speed claim | A REAL embedding checkpoint (e5-mistral class) + a same-box `vllm.LLM(task="embed")` oracle; only then does an embed-throughput bar exist |
| Parakeet/FastConformer ASR (P1-P4 + ONE-SURFACE fold ROW 1) | **NO number measured, claimed or owed.** Correctness-gated only, CPU f32; the 2026-08-07 surface fold (`vllm_transcribe`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions`) is transcript-byte-identical plumbing, no speed claim. | Floor is `parakeet.cpp`, same clip and box; needs a CUDA provider and a pretrained checkpoint |
| Async serving correctness (#323) | **FIXED**: the decode graph replayed stale HOST token ids, degenerating concurrent requests past slot 0 (classic-dense, graph on = default). Graph declines while the mirror is live; async 7/7, SACRED 184/184 | Graph to read ids at REPLAY |
| Ampere consumer (`sm_86`, RTX 3090 class) | **No number owed; no such board here.** 2026-08-06 build-verify: 7/7 FA2 TUs 0-warn, real `sm_86` SASS. [Detail](../.agents/benchmark-record.md) | External RTX 3090 report. Floor is llama.cpp on that card (GGUF, not our Blackwell-only NVFP4 grid) |
| Pre-Ampere breadth (Turing `sm_75` / Volta `sm_70` / Pascal) | **No number owed; nothing runs on these arches.** 2026-08-06 `sm_75`: 20/20 TUs PASS (0 err/warn), WMMA bodies + all 3 selectors arch-gated; GB10 SASS byte-identical. [Detail](../.agents/benchmark-record.md) | Full-library LINK at `sm_75` + `cuobjdump` SASS, then a build-supported row. The fp16 `fattn` port is speed-only now; its floor when a card exists is llama.cpp on that card |

## Reproduce

| Benchmark | Entry point |
|---|---|
| vLLM online grid | `.agents/specs/competitive-benchmarks.md`, evidence under `dgx:~/work/vllm.cpp-online-gate/evidence/` |
| CPU vs llama.cpp | Same GGUF both arms, 3 reps under one `flock $HOME/gpu.lock`; `VT_GGUF_KEEP_F16=0` reproduces the pre-L7 baseline |
| Laguna NVFP4 decode | `flock $HOME/gpu.lock ./build-cuda/examples/laguna-gen --model ~/laguna-xs-nvfp4 --gpu` (that directory holds the S-2.1 checkpoint); `drop_caches` first, create the CUDA context before loading weights |
| DeepSeek-V4-Flash decode | `deepseek-v4-gen --gpu --kv-cache` on `ds4flash.gguf`, captured under tmux |
| Metal vs MLX-LM | Paired A/B harness, interleaved runs, cold legs discarded |
| Vulkan vs llama.cpp Vulkan | Same GGUF both arms: ours `-DVLLM_CPP_VULKAN=ON`, llama.cpp `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON` at `237ad9b96` via `llama-bench`; clean legs only, one `flock $HOME/gpu.lock`. GEMV sweep: `benchmarks/vulkan_gemv_ab.cpp` |
