# Building vllm.cpp

vllm.cpp uses CMake (>= 3.24) and a C++20 compiler (gcc 13/14 and clang are
exercised; the tree builds -Werror-clean on gcc 14.2). The core has no ML
dependencies; the OpenAI server uses a vendored header-only HTTP transport
(cpp-httplib). The [README](../README.md) carries the two-line quickstart; this
page is the full build reference.

## Build out-of-source

Every recipe on this page configures into a separate build directory, and that
is a requirement, not a style preference: the example targets are named after
the directories they are built from (`examples/tokenize` builds `tokenize`,
`examples/dump_container` builds `dump_container`, ...), so `cmake .` asks the
linker to write each executable on top of its own source directory and fails
with `cannot open output file <target>: Is a directory` (issue #85).

Configure refuses an in-source build up front and says so. If an earlier attempt
already wrote into the checkout, clear it with
`rm -rf CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles`.

## CPU build (the correctness / CI reference)

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build
```

The server is ON by default. Example binaries land under `build/examples/`:
`vllm-cli`, `vllm-server`, `vllm-bench`, and `tokenize`.

## CUDA build (NVIDIA GB10 / DGX Spark)

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-cuda \
  -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON \
  -DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_FETCH=ON
cmake --build build-cuda -j
```

Triton-AOT cubins for the fast GDN path are **vendored**: Python and Triton are
needed only to regenerate them (`VLLM_CPP_TRITON_REGEN`), never to build or run
them. Because building them needs nothing a CUDA build does not already have,
`VLLM_CPP_TRITON` defaults **ON** for a CUDA build and the line above no longer
carries it; `-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=OFF` drops back to the hand C++/CUDA kernels,
which stay the always-available fallback.

### CUTLASS: the one external build dependency

CUTLASS (>= 4.5.0) is header-only, and it is the only thing a CUDA build fetches
from the network. It feeds two independent consumers:

- **FlashAttention-2** prefill/decode, on every arch in `8.0 8.6 8.7 8.9 12.0a 12.1a`.
- The **sm_12xa NVFP4 block-scaled GEMM**, on Blackwell only.

Without it the FA2 kernels are not compiled and attention falls back to the
portable path, which is slower. Nothing fails and no test goes red, so it is
worth being deliberate about. Pick one:

```sh
-DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_FETCH=ON            # download CUTLASS 4.5.0 (~200 MB, needs network)
-DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_DIR=/path/to/cutlass  # reuse a checkout you already have
```

The default is neither, so that a disk- or network-constrained box configures
without surprises. When you skip it on an arch that supports FA2, configure
prints a `CMake Warning` saying so.

Confirm you got it from the configure output:

```
-- CUDA feature fa2: ENABLED for [86]
-- FlashAttention-2 prefill/decode: ENABLED for arch(es) [86] (runtime toggles VT_FA2_PREFILL, VT_FA2_DECODE)
```

The first line means the arch supports FA2; the second means it was actually
built. If only the first appears, CUTLASS was not found.

### Other CUDA families

Set the arch explicitly. It defaults to `121a` (GB10), which will not load on
anything else:

```sh
# Hopper H100/H200
cmake -S . -B build-cuda -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=90a \
  -DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_FETCH=ON

# Ampere consumer (RTX 3090 = 86), Ada (89), Jetson Orin (87)
cmake -S . -B build-cuda -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86 \
  -DVLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_FETCH=ON
```

Of these, only `sm_87` (Orin) and `sm_110` (Thor) have been run on real
hardware. `sm_80/86/89`, `sm_90a` and `sm_100a/103a` are build-verified: they
compile `-Werror`-clean and emit the expected SASS, but no board here has
executed them. See [Project status](../README.md#project-status) for what that label means and
`.agents/specs/cuda-arch-ampere-fastpath.md` for the per-arch detail. Reports
from those boards are welcome.

## Metal build (Apple Silicon)

Metal is detected automatically on an Apple host with an ObjC++ compiler. The
optional MLX GEMM provider is a separate opt-in and needs an MLX install:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-metal -DVLLM_CPP_MLX=ON -DMLX_ROOT=/path/to/mlx
cmake --build build-metal -j
```

MLX is shape-gated to prefill, where it wins; it declines the `m < 2` decode
GEMV by design. Note that an MLX build produces a **different greedy sequence**
than the default build (MLX's GEMM is not bit-identical), so goldens must not be
re-anchored to an MLX build. Details in [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

## Vulkan build

Headers are vendored and SPIR-V is committed, so no graphics toolchain is
needed. It is off unless requested:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-vulkan -DVLLM_CPP_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build-vulkan -j
```

## Tenstorrent build (Blackhole)

The Tenstorrent backend is opt-in and requires local TT-Metalium and TT-NN
package installations. Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at the built tt-metal install
tree. Configure fails instead of silently producing a CPU-only build when
either package is missing.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-tenstorrent \
  -DVLLM_CPP_TENSTORRENT=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/tt-metal/install
cmake --build build-tenstorrent -j
```

The Blackhole lane is correctness-focused. OPT-125m passes its strict 6/6
end-to-end gate. Qwen3-0.6B is selected by the platform and has a device-aware
near-tie gate plus committed goldens, but the full 16x16 rerun is still pending.
There is no binding speed result.

## ROCm build (AMD GPUs)

Enable ROCm explicitly and use a release build:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-hip \
  -DVLLM_CPP_HIP=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm
cmake --build build-hip -j
ctest --test-dir build-hip -R 'rocm|cross_device' --output-on-failure
```

Set `ROCM_PATH` to your ROCm or TheRock installation prefix. When that directory
exists, CMake derives the compiler root, HIP flags, and environment hint from it.
Explicit `CMAKE_HIP_COMPILER_ROCM_ROOT`, `CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS`, `HIPFLAGS`, and
`ROCM_PATH` environment settings take precedence over the corresponding hints.
Configuration fails if `VLLM_CPP_HIP=ON` cannot find a HIP compiler.

Set `VLLM_CPP_HIP_ARCHITECTURES` to select targets, for example
`-DVLLM_CPP_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1100`. Leave it empty to use the compiler's
default target selection. CMake warns about unlisted architectures but passes
them to the compiler.

For an empty build type or `Debug`, CMake adds `-O1` to HIP device compilation
unless `CMAKE_HIP_FLAGS` contains an explicit `-O` option. This avoids the
unoptimized kernel path associated with a ROCm teardown deadlock
([#132](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/132)). Other build types keep
their own optimization settings.

The backend includes native dense, attention, GDN, sampling, and EXL3 operations.
Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct EXL3 generated on gfx1151 with zero CPU fallbacks.
That result does not establish discrete AMD coverage or competitive performance.
The [EXL3 evidence](../.agents/specs/backend-rocm-exl3.md#evidence) records the
workload and remaining gates.

CPU fallback depends on the device's memory attributes. By default, gfx1151 and
gfx1103 use plain `hipMalloc` and require native coverage for every model operation.
See the [ROCm guide](ROCM.md) for allocation behavior, device selection, tested
models, and unresolved correctness gates.

## Nix shells

The checked-in flake pins CMake, Ninja and the CUDA toolchain, so nothing has
to be globally installed:

```sh
# CPU (correctness / CI reference)
nix develop .#default --command cmake -S . -B build-nix-cpu -G Ninja \
  -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
nix develop .#default --command cmake --build build-nix-cpu -j4

# CUDA (set the arch for your GPU)
nix develop .#cuda --command bash -lc \
  'cmake -S . -B build-nix-cuda -G Ninja -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA=ON \
    -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER="$CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER" \
    -DCMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER="$CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER" \
    -DVLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120a -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo'
nix develop .#cuda --command cmake --build build-nix-cuda -j4
```

On NixOS the CUDA shell exports the driver-library path and
`TRITON_LIBCUDA_PATH=/run/opengl-driver/lib` so Triton finds `libcuda` without
`/sbin/ldconfig`.

## CMake options

Read from [`CMakeLists.txt`](../CMakeLists.txt). Defaults shown are the shipped
defaults.

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_CPP_CUDA` | `AUTO` | Build the CUDA backend: `ON`, `OFF`, or `AUTO` (on when a CUDA toolchain is found) |
| `VLLM_CPP_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` | `121a` | Target CUDA arch(s): `121a` (GB10), `120a`/`120a;121a` (consumer Blackwell), and cross-family targets `90a`, `80`/`86`/`87`/`89`, `100a`/`103a`, `110`. The `a` suffix is required for the native fp4 MMA |
| `VLLM_CPP_METAL` | `AUTO` | Build the Metal backend: `ON`, `OFF`, or `AUTO` (on for an Apple host with an ObjC++ compiler) |
| `VLLM_CPP_VULKAN` | `AUTO` (= `OFF`) | Build the Vulkan backend. Opt-in with `-DVLLM_CPP_VULKAN=ON`; headers are vendored and SPIR-V is committed |
| `VLLM_CPP_TENSTORRENT` | `AUTO` (= `OFF`) | Build the Tenstorrent backend. Opt-in with `-DVLLM_CPP_TENSTORRENT=ON`; requires TT-Metalium and TT-NN and fails configure if either package is missing |
| `VLLM_CPP_HIP` | `AUTO` (= `OFF`) | Build the ROCm backend. Opt-in with `-DVLLM_CPP_HIP=ON`. Configuration fails without a HIP compiler. See [ROCm coverage](ROCM.md) |
| `VLLM_CPP_HIP_ARCHITECTURES` | (empty) | Target `gfx` architectures, for example `gfx1100` or `gfx1100;gfx1151`. Empty uses compiler defaults |
| `ROCM_PATH` | `/opt/rocm` | ROCm installation prefix, for a nightly/TheRock install elsewhere |
| `VLLM_CPP_MLX` | `OFF` | Build the optional MLX GEMM provider for Metal (needs `-DMLX_ROOT=<mlx install>`) |
| `MLX_ROOT` | (empty) | Root of an MLX install (`include/` + `lib/`) for `VLLM_CPP_MLX` |
| `VLLM_CPP_SERVER` | `ON` | Build the OpenAI HTTP server (needs `third_party/httplib/httplib.h`; disables itself with a warning if absent) |
| `VLLM_CPP_TRITON` | computed: `ON` for a CUDA build with the vendored trees present, else `OFF` | Consume the vendored per-arch Triton-AOT GDN cubins (CUDA only; no Python needed). It ships ON because the artifacts are pre-generated cubins embedded in plain C — a C compiler is the whole requirement. It declines, with one `STATUS` line naming the condition, when `VLLM_CPP_CUDA` is `OFF`, when `VLLM_CPP_TRITON_REGEN` is `ON`, or when a vendored tree is absent, incomplete, or older than the `triton_kernels/*.py` it was generated from — the same conditions the build itself refuses to consume, checked before the default is set so it can decline instead of failing your configure. Turn it off with `-DVLLM_CPP_TRITON=OFF` |
| `VLLM_CPP_TRITON_REGEN` | `OFF` | Maintainer knob: regenerate the AOT cubins with Python + Triton |
| `VLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_DIR` | `third_party/cutlass` | CUTLASS source root (>= 4.5.0). Feeds the sm120a NVFP4 GEMM **and** FlashAttention-2 on `8.0/8.6/8.7/8.9/12.0a/12.1a`. Absent on an FA2-capable arch, configure warns and FA2 is not built |
| `VLLM_CPP_CUTLASS_FETCH` | `OFF` | FetchContent CUTLASS 4.5.0 if not found locally (~200 MB, needs network) |
| `VLLM_CPP_MARLIN` | `ON` | Build the vendored Marlin NVFP4 W4A16 MoE GEMM (sm_12xa) |
| `VLLM_CPP_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` | Compile and register ctest targets |
| `VLLM_CPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | `ON` | Build the example CLI, server, and bench binaries |
| `VLLM_CPP_BENCH_PROFILE_CONTROL` | `OFF` | Trace-only profiler replay control (never for production timing builds) |
