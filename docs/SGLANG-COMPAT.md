# SGLang-compatible behaviors

vllm.cpp mirrors vLLM by default, and additionally exposes a small set of
**SGLang-inspired runtime knobs** as first-class, documented toggles. Each one is
**opt-in and defaults to today's behavior**, a caller (library, C ABI, or
server) that sets none of them gets an engine byte-identical to one built without
them.

Four behaviors are covered here. For each: what it does, how to enable it three
ways, (a) the C++ library API (`vllm::entrypoints::EngineParams`), (b) the C ABI
(`include/vllm.h`, `vllm_model_params`), (c) the OpenAI server CLI, and the
honest caveat where one applies. The behavior parity itself is tracked in
[`.agents/sglang-matrix.md`](../.agents/sglang-matrix.md); the ABI-field table and
grounding live in [`.agents/specs/sglang-enablement.md`](../.agents/specs/sglang-enablement.md).

| Behavior | Knob | Default | Output effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| RadixAttention / prefix caching | `enable_prefix_caching` (tri-state, ABI v7) | model default | none (cache reuse) |
| LPM cache-aware scheduling | `scheduling_policy = "lpm"` (string, ABI v9) | `fcfs` | none (admission order) |
| Jump-forward decoding | `enable_jump_forward` (tri-state, ABI v10) | off, **and inert when set** ([§3](#3-jump-forward-decoding)) | none |
| Custom logits processors | per-request sampling callback (ABI v8) | none | user-defined |

---

## 1. RadixAttention (automatic prefix caching)

**What it does.** SGLang's RadixAttention keeps a radix tree of KV prefixes and
serves the longest cached prefix of each new request instead of recomputing it.
In vllm.cpp this is **fused into our block-hash automatic prefix caching (APC)**,
there is no separate radix code path; `--enable-radix-attention` is a documented
alias for the APC toggle (see
[`.agents/specs/sglang-radixattention.md`](../.agents/specs/sglang-radixattention.md)
§1). It is output-neutral: it only reuses already-computed KV.

**Enable it.**

(a) C++ library API, `EngineParams::enable_prefix_caching` (tri-state
`std::optional<bool>`):

```cpp
vllm::entrypoints::EngineParams ep;
ep.enable_prefix_caching = true;   // force ON; std::nullopt => model default
auto engine = vllm::entrypoints::LoadedEngine::FromModelDir(model_dir, ep);
```

(b) C ABI, `vllm_model_params.enable_prefix_caching` (ABI v7), tri-state
`0`=model default, `1`=on, `2`=off:

```c
vllm_model_params mp = vllm_model_params_default();
mp.model_path = "/models/Qwen3.6-27B";
mp.enable_prefix_caching = 1;      /* 0 => model default (byte-identical) */
vllm_engine *engine = NULL;
vllm_engine_load(&mp, &engine);
```

(c) Server CLI, vLLM's flag, with the SGLang alias:

```bash
server --model /models/Qwen3.6-27B --enable-prefix-caching
# equivalently: server --model /models/Qwen3.6-27B --enable-radix-attention
# disable: --no-enable-prefix-caching  (alias --disable-radix-attention)
```

**Caveat.** SGLang's SW2 throughput lever (avoiding a redundant same-step prefill
by de-prioritizing the second in-batch collider) is **NOT-APPLICABLE** to our APC:
we cache blocks at allocation time, so the second same-step collider already hits
the first's just-cached prefix, the redundant prefill never occurs here. The
admission-order half of that behavior is folded into LPM scheduling below.

---

## 2. LPM cache-aware scheduling

**What it does.** SGLang's `--schedule-policy=lpm` reorders the waiting queue by
each request's **longest matched cached prefix**, so requests that will hit the
cache are admitted first (maximizing cache reuse under load). vllm.cpp implements
this as the `lpm` scheduling policy over our block-hash APC index. It is
**output-neutral**, it changes admission *order* only; every request computes
identical tokens, and is meaningful **only with prefix caching ON**. With APC
off it degrades to `fcfs`.

**Enable it.**

(a) C++ library API, `EngineParams::policy`:

```cpp
vllm::entrypoints::EngineParams ep;
ep.policy = vllm::SchedulerPolicy::kLPM;   // kFCFS (default) / kPriority / kLPM
ep.enable_prefix_caching = true;           // LPM needs a cache to match against
```

(b) C ABI, `vllm_model_params.scheduling_policy` (ABI v9). A string naming the
policy: `"fcfs"` (default), `"priority"`, or `"lpm"`; `NULL`/`""` => `"fcfs"`.
(There is no separate int scheduler-policy field, the string is the one knob.)

```c
vllm_model_params mp = vllm_model_params_default();
mp.model_path = "/models/Qwen3.6-27B";
mp.scheduling_policy = "lpm";       /* NULL/"" => "fcfs" (byte-identical) */
mp.enable_prefix_caching = 1;        /* recommended: lpm degrades to fcfs w/o APC */
vllm_engine *engine = NULL;
vllm_engine_load(&mp, &engine);
```

(c) Server CLI, vLLM's flag name (`--scheduling-policy`) and SGLang's alias
(`--schedule-policy`), both taking `fcfs|priority|lpm`:

```bash
server --model /models/Qwen3.6-27B --enable-prefix-caching --scheduling-policy lpm
```

**Caveat.** LPM has no effect with prefix caching disabled (the server logs a
warning and falls back to `fcfs` admission order). SGLang itself later **removed
its jump-forward scheduler wiring upstream**, but its LPM scheduling remains; ours
is a scoped opt-in behavior flag, not a blind mirror (vLLM has no `lpm` policy).

---

## 3. Jump-forward decoding

**Status: the knob is wired, the decoding is not.** This behavior has **no
production caller**. The flag, the ABI field, the environment override, the
grammar forced-token hook and the driver that drains forced tokens all exist and
have unit tests. No served request reaches the driver, so **setting this today
changes nothing**. The missing piece is the scheduler splice, which has to
recompute KV for the tokens the model never ran. The work is
`ENG-STRUCTURED-OUTPUT`, tracked by
[issue #2387](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2387). Read the rest of
this section as the shape the knob already has, not as a speed switch you can
turn on.

**What it will do.** When a structured-output grammar has a **deterministic forced
continuation**, jump-forward emits it *without* running the model per token, the
speed win on constrained decoding. The scope here is the **provably
byte-identical token-unique subset**, and the driver that exists implements
exactly that: it jumps only while the grammar admits exactly one valid
token at a non-accepting state, so the emitted token is the argmax under any
sampling params (the constrained sampler masks every other token to `-inf`). The
general byte-forced-but-multi-tokenizable span (which needs SGLang's re-tokenize +
boundary rollback) is deliberately not jumped.

**Set it.** The three spellings in this section are accepted and validated
today, and all three are inert. They stay documented because the knob is a
published surface, ABI v10 included, and because a caller that sets one now does
not have to change when the splice lands.

(a) C++ library API, `EngineParams::enable_jump_forward` (tri-state
`std::optional<bool>`):

```cpp
vllm::entrypoints::EngineParams ep;
ep.enable_jump_forward = true;   // nullopt (default) => OFF unless env override
```

(b) C ABI, `vllm_model_params.enable_jump_forward` (ABI v10), tri-state
`0`=default (env-resolved, off), `1`=on, `2`=off:

```c
vllm_model_params mp = vllm_model_params_default();
mp.model_path = "/models/Qwen3.6-27B";
mp.enable_jump_forward = 1;         /* 0 => default OFF (byte-identical) */
vllm_engine *engine = NULL;
vllm_engine_load(&mp, &engine);
```

(c) Server CLI:

```bash
server --model /models/Qwen3.6-27B --enable-jump-forward   # or --disable-jump-forward
```

The server accepts this line and rejects the flag if you pass it twice. It then
prints no warning and decodes exactly as it would without the flag. See
[What `--enable-jump-forward` does not do yet](reference/server.md#what---enable-jump-forward-does-not-do-yet).

**Precedence with the env var.** The legacy `VT_ENABLE_JUMP_FORWARD` env var stays
as an override: **when it is set, it wins** over the C-ABI / C++ / server field
(`1`/`true`/`on` => on, anything else => off), mirroring the `VT_ASYNC_SCHED`
convention. When it is unset, the field decides (default off).

**Caveat.** Two limits apply, and the first is the one that matters today. The
production scheduler splice has not landed, so the knob selects nothing and no
setting buys the speed win. [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](ENVIRONMENT.md) says the same of
`VT_ENABLE_JUMP_FORWARD`, which drives only the standalone driver. Second, after
the splice lands the scope is still the **token-unique subset only**, and the
general byte-forced-but-multi-tokenizable span stays a named residual. Both
limits are safe rather than lossy. A jumped token is byte-identical to per-token
constrained decode, so nothing here can change an output. SGLang removed its own
jump-forward scheduler wiring upstream.

---

## 4. Custom logits processors

**What it does.** A per-request host callback the sampler invokes **once per decode
step, before sampling**, to inspect the tokens generated so far and modify the
logits in place (add a bias, mask tokens, force a token). This satisfies SGLang's
`CustomLogitProcessor` capability (e.g. a thinking-budget processor) and mirrors
vLLM's `SamplingParams.logits_processors`. It runs at vLLM's
non-argmax-invariant logits-processor stage.

**Enable it.**

(a) / (b) C ABI, `vllm_sampling_params.logits_processor` +
`logits_processor_user_data` (ABI v8). The C++ library drives the same sampler
stage; the callback is the delivery surface:

```c
static void my_proc(const int32_t *tokens, int32_t n, float *logits,
                    int32_t vocab, void *user_data) {
  logits[42] = 1e30f;  /* force token 42 (greedy will pick it) */
}
vllm_sampling_params sp = vllm_sampling_params_default();
sp.logits_processor = my_proc;               /* NULL => no processor (default) */
sp.logits_processor_user_data = NULL;
vllm_complete(engine, "hi", &sp, &out);
```

(c) Server CLI, not a CLI flag: it is a per-request programmatic hook (a function
pointer), so it is exposed through the C ABI / library, not the server flags.

**Caveat.** This is a single C callback per request (a function pointer +
`user_data`), not a batched plugin graph, and there is no Python-side / dill
registration. It is otherwise the same capability as vLLM's and SGLang's
per-request logit processor.

## When to enable (guidance)

These knobs are **correctness-neutral plumbing, not free speed switches**, whether
they help is workload-dependent, and the shared-prefix performance arm that would
put a number on the gain is **not yet measured** (tracked as
`BACKEND-GATE-CUDA-SGLANG-PREFIX`; the first SGLang competitor-floor run was
cache-neutral). Honest per-knob guidance:

- **RadixAttention / prefix caching**, enable when the workload has **shared
  prefixes** (a common system prompt, few-shot exemplars, multi-turn chat). It
  reuses cached prefix KV instead of recomputing, a real win there; neutral to
  slight overhead when there is no sharing. Already on by default for dense models.
- **LPM scheduling**, enable **together with prefix caching** when concurrent
  requests share prefixes: it admits cache-hitting requests first, raising the hit
  rate under load. It has no effect without APC (falls back to `fcfs`), and it
  changes admission order, so leave it off for latency-sensitive single-stream use.
- **Jump-forward decoding**, a niche constrained-decoding speed lever that is
  **not connected yet**
  ([#2387](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2387)). No workload gains
  from setting it, because setting it neither speeds a workload up nor slows one
  down. After the scheduler splice lands the lever stays conservative
  (token-unique subset only), worth setting only for structured output that
  matches that pattern, and never a general throughput knob.
- **Custom logits processors**, a programmatic per-request hook, not a performance
  knob; use it when you need per-request logit control (a bias, a mask, a forced
  token, a thinking budget).

**Bottom line:** turn on RadixAttention (and LPM) for **prefix-heavy serving**,
where the reuse is real; the rest are situational. Do not enable everything blindly
for speed. Measured numbers for the prefix-cache-on gain are pending the
shared-prefix benchmark.

## Default inertness

Setting **none** of these knobs (all C-ABI fields `0`/`NULL`, no server flags, no
`VT_ENABLE_JUMP_FORWARD`) yields an engine byte-identical to one built before
these knobs existed. Jump-forward is inert whether it is set or not
([#2387](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2387)), so for that one knob
this holds in both directions. This is enforced by the CPU exact-gate suites
(`tests/capi/test_capi.cpp`, `tests/vllm/v1/test_scheduler_lpm.cpp`,
`tests/vllm/v1/structured_output/test_jump_forward.cpp`).
