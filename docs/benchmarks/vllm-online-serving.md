# vLLM, online serving

The binding comparison. vLLM runs its **production graphed config**, never
`--enforce-eager`. Every `0.25.0` row below is **SUPERSEDED and OPTIMISTIC**, on
two counts that both flattered us: the harness enforced the `0.25.0` ROLLBACK
and *raised* on the pin until 2026-08-12
([#520](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/520)), and the same runs never
passed `--language-model-only`, so the denominator ran vLLM's UNFUSED
QK-norm+RoPE+gate path
([#414](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/414)). Nothing is withdrawn.
The first series free of both, at the pin, graphed, and at a pinned clock is in
[the benchmark record](../../.agents/benchmark-record.md).

### Qwen3.6-27B by concurrency

Medians of three interleaved repetitions, 1,024 in / 128 out, cache off, closed
loop. Output is token-for-token identical to vLLM at every point. The `nvidia`
ModelOpt table that follows is a DIFFERENT checkpoint on a DIFFERENT axis and
must not be compared against this one: a 7-token prompt scored on OUTPUT tokens
per second, with method, attribution and the owed 1,024 in / 128 out axis in
[the benchmark record](../../.agents/benchmark-record.md).

| Concurrency | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **vllm.cpp** TOTAL tok/s | **86.05** | 159.68 | 292.34 | 508.77 | 801.76 | 1095.01 |
| vLLM TOTAL tok/s | 82.32 | 158.03 | 290.31 | 505.46 | 789.16 | 1076.25 |
| **Ratio** | **1.045x** | 1.011x | 1.007x | 1.007x | 1.016x | 1.017x |
| Axes passing | 20/20 | 20/20 | 18/20 | 15/20 | 19/20 | 18/20 |

TOTAL tokens per second (prompt plus output), not a decode rate: c1's 86.05 is
about 10 tok/s of decode plus about 940 of prefill. The `nvidia` table below
counts OUTPUT only, hence its c1 of 10.41.
We are nominally ahead at all six, but only c1 means anything. Our run-to-run
noise band is 0.5% and c2 through c32 land between 0.7% and 1.7%, so **treat
those five as ties**, not as wins. The nine axes that fail in both grids are one
tradeoff, not nine problems: our synchronous deterministic forward loses on
low-concurrency *median* decode and TTFT, and wins the corresponding *tail* and
the same metric at higher concurrency (c8 p99 ITL 0.86x, but 1.055x at c16 and
1.078x at c32).

**There is no isolated c2/c8 weakness.** Binding grid at `a0fa12c7`
(2026-08-10), 3 reps, binding-eligible 12/12; the prior c2 0.87x / c8 0.92x
"weak cells" came from a different harness and were never comparable. The
deficit is a flat mid-band (c2 to c16 within 0.935x-0.949x, CoV under 0.81% on
both engines) and is entirely MARGINAL per-token work, since our FIXED per-step
cost already beats vLLM (9.02 ms against 9.43 ms). Two glue levers land against
it, both default ON: the fused shared-expert gate_up sink off the MoE-marlin
route (**+1.31% c8 / +1.38% c4**, `VT_MARLIN_DENSE_PAIR`) and the shared
`down_proj` emitted as bf16 rather than f32 (**+2.05% c8 / +0.79% c4**,
bit-identical, `VT_SHARED_DOWN_BF16`).

The SiLU lever is NEGATIVE ([spec](../../.agents/specs/moe-silu-vectorize.md)):
the 9.2x per-launch gap that motivated it was a MEAN over a bimodal kernel
(min 1.34 us, max 979 us) and our decode-phase SiLU is already faster than
vLLM's, so the remaining band is unattributed. The
marlin block-size lever is REFUTED (block 8 at c8 is 1.16% SLOWER against a
+0.29% control), and a per-launch marlin gap is WITHDRAWN as cross-tool
uncertainty. Memory passes decisively: peak PSS **3.81x**, peak GPU **1.40x**.
Detail in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`.

**Device-resident sampled tokens on integrated (`VT_ASYNC_DEVICE_MIRROR`) A/B'd
2026-08-06, speed-NEUTRAL** (same-binary): c16 OFF median 2305.8 vs ON 2303.3
(0.999x), c32 2928.9 vs 2919.1 (0.997x), bands overlap. It is a drain MOVE (relocate
the drain past the host prep, not remove it), so it overlaps only the small host
prep; the drain still serializes GPU input staging, so c16 does not recover. The
drain REMOVAL, `VT_ASYNC_EXECUTOR` Option A (`row/SERVE-ASYNC-OPTION-A`, default-OFF,
input H2D staged out of capture, the faithful vLLM structure), is GREEN + RED-reproducing
but binding-A/B speed-NEUTRAL (c8/c16/c32 +0.0-0.1%), so the c16 gap is NOT the async
input path. Detail in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`.

**But the mirror FIXES a shipping correctness bug, so it is now DEFAULT ON
(ROW-SERVE-ASYNC-LLM, 2026-08-06).** Baseline async (AsyncLLM depth-2) batch-1 greedy
decode degenerated into nondeterministic token-0 garbage; the mirror is deterministic
and coherent. The missing gate now exists, `test_qwen36_async_serving` (depth-2
AsyncLLM, batch-1 + concurrency, token-exact vs the SACRED oracle): RED on `=0`, GREEN
on the default. c16 re-checked on the default: 2312.9/2303.9/2294.4 (median
**2303.9**), c32 2942.7 (no regression). Root cause + file:line in the benchmark
record. The same P0 hit classic dense `Qwen3ForCausalLM` (quant-independent), fixed by `ROW-SERVE-ASYNC-DENSE-MIRROR` (see the MXFP4 Qwen3-8B row). The intake-drain lever likewise measured NEUTRAL (2026-08-06, `VT_INTAKE_DRAIN` A/B 3+3 reps): admitting during the forward wait collapses intake -91% but shifts it into queued, arrival-to-scheduled invariant, so the recorded INTAKE term is an attribution boundary over a GPU-bound prefill wait, not reducible; lever reverted, byte-exact `VT_LOOP_TRACE` probe kept.

| Settled: the HOST rebooted | (c1 landed) | (cell stands) | OBSERVED: `boot_id` moved `3fd9745a-...` -> `64c495a3-...` in a later leased job, so not a lost pod. DERIVED, only if it does not virtualize `/proc`: boot at or before 10:41:47.6Z, one-sided. Causation NOT traced |
| #915's own-arm debt, DISCHARGED | prior 2.37 -> 4.4040 tok/s while median TPOT moved 220.6 -> 218.11 | (cell stands) | prior 15.96 -> 22.6402 while TPOT moved 261.1 -> 250.57. Different boots, so read the SHAPE, not the percentage |
| What that shape proves | throughput moved a lot, per-token barely at all; qualitative, the boots differ: the throughput axis was dividing live tokens by a wall still holding dead requests ([#931](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/931)) | (cell stands) | withholding 0.677x rather than publishing it was correct, and this is the evidence for that |
| A divergence found in the raw files | our `usage.prompt_tokens` reports 5,942 where vLLM reports 6,144 on identical prompts; 19 of 48 short at c8 | (cell stands) | `output_lens` is `[128]xN` on both arms, so TPOT and ITL stand. Total-token throughput is CORRUPTED, and output throughput is BIASED UP, next row |
| Size of that bias, which EXCEEDS our own stated precision | if the prompts were truly truncated the wall is short by ~0.22 s of 174.39 s, about **0.13%**, beside a published CV of 0.039% | (cell stands) | ~1.1-1.6 s of 271.0 s, about **0.4-0.6%**, beside a published CV of 0.205%. A lower bound: shorter context also cheapens decode |
| Are the two TTFT medians still comparable? | YES, by evidence and not by luck: our two short prompts are the two LOWEST TTFTs in all three reps, so both arms' medians fall on 1024-token requests | (cell stands) | no vLLM leg exists to compare against |
| Why only c4 counts | `output_throughput` divides tokens by a wall duration that still contains the dead request, so a cell where one arm dropped requests is withheld, not quoted | 3 paired reps, clocks 2184 MHz | token gate: 4/7 strict, 3 exact fp32 ties ([#915](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/915)) |

### Qwen3.8-27B quantized arms, both gates PENDING and no number quoted

| Arm | Oracle, and why that one | Gate | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Qwen3.8-27B-Q4_K_M.gguf` (`unsloth` @`fe1e2a23`) | llama.cpp `b10451`, the ONLY comparator: vLLM has no in-tree GGUF reader at pin `555967922` and SGLang's aliases miss `qwen3_5` ([#979](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/979)). Its oracle, never its mirror | **PENDING**, no number | [#857](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/857): `.agents/oracles/llama-cpp.md` records the pin `gateable = no` and #857 owes that measurement |
| `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` @`7d6f8d4d` | vLLM `555967922`, the MIRROR and primary oracle, which runs this format | **PENDING**, no number | [#1185](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/1185): the pinned oracle builds, installs and imports in an `rc` lease, but RUNNING a model there is untested |
| Why no number may be quoted yet | Correctness precedes speed and neither arm loads: the "NVFP4" file is `mixed-precision` with ZERO `*.input_scale` tensors, and the Q4_K_M file's block 64 is the MTP drafter (`nextn_predict_layers = 1`) | spec'd, not implemented | [#821](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/821), [spec](../../.agents/specs/qwen38-27b-quant-arms.md) |
| What a token gate alone would miss | Each arm owes a resident-bytes assertion beside its tokens: a Q4_K_M arm that silently dequantizes to bf16 passes every token gate and defeats the point of the arm | owed, not measured | [#821](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/821) |

### DeepSeek-V2-Lite (MLA)

Medians of 3 reps, 1,024 in / 128 out. The vLLM arm runs `--moe-backend triton`,
which is its best **stable** graphed config on GB10: the auto-selected FlashInfer
CUTLASS MoE backend hard-rebooted the box five times. The substitution does not
flatter us, we lose against it.

| Concurrency | Output tok/s ours / vLLM | Ratio | Median TTFT | Median TPOT |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 33.18 / 38.17 | 0.87x | 0.95x | 0.90x |
| 2 | 52.63 / 55.27 | 0.95x | 0.88x | **1.03x** |
| 4 | 70.36 / 81.51 | 0.86x | **1.04x** | 0.86x |
| 8 | 102.37 / 116.35 | 0.88x | **1.12x** | 0.86x |

Peak memory is the decisive win: **31.38 GiB against vLLM's 68.5 GiB**, with the
caveat that vLLM pre-reserves a fixed fraction up front while we allocate the KV
blocks the workload needs. Real difference in operating footprint, not evidence
of a lower per-token KV cost.

### Laguna-S-2.1 (NVFP4)

`poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4`, 118B total / ~8B active MoE, 48 layers,
256 experts, ~67 GiB. Both arms NVFP4, single request, batch 1, GB10. The local
checkpoint directory is named `laguna-xs-nvfp4`, which is where the "Laguna-XS"
label in earlier revisions of this page came from; the measured model is S-2.1.

| Arm | Decode tok/s | Ratio |
|---|---:|---:|
| vLLM NVFP4, graphed | 43.10 | 1.00x |
| **vllm.cpp NVFP4**, resident decode + CUDA graph | **44.46** | **1.03x** |

The gap is CLOSED (2026-08-04, same-tool nsys graph-node tracing on both
engines). Root cause: the bf16 M=1 projection GEMVs (o_proj, qkv, router,
dense, lm_head) read their weights from GB10 UNIFIED/ATS host memory (a
`w.View()` device retag, no `cudaMalloc` staging), which the GPU reads slower
than true device memory. `VT_LAGUNA_RESIDENT_BF16W` (default-ON parity enabler)
stages every projection device-resident (one H2D copy at load); byte-exact
(ids bit-identical to the `=0` retag arm). Binding new-default decode is 44.46
tok/s (median-of-3), 1.03x vs vLLM's graphed 43.10.

Per-call the residency recovers o_proj 194 to 131 us (about 168 to 249 GB/s),
qkv 245 to 225 us, and lm_head 2410 to 1620 us/call. This supersedes the earlier
invocation / bf16-output-`cublasGemmEx` framing (measured a wash): the
invocation was never the cause, the weight's memory RESIDENCY was. Full
forensics in `.agents/benchmark-record.md`.

Memory: the roughly 2.6 GB of bf16 device copies sit in the 119 GB GB10 unified
pool; peak host RSS is unchanged at about 40.7 GiB (device/unified allocations
are not counted in `ru_maxrss`), so there is no memory regression.
