# Model recipes

Read a model recipe when a checkpoint needs extra files, model-specific flags,
or when it has a known limitation. Read [the quickstart](../QUICKSTART.md) to
run your first model, and [the usage guide](../USAGE.md) for the shared CLI,
server, C ABI, and source-tree workflows.

Each page tells you the same four things in the same order: what the model is,
which checkpoint was used, the exact command, and what has not been measured.

## Text generation

| Model | What it is | Read the page for |
|---|---|---|
| [Qwen3.8 2.4T](qwen3-8-2-4t.md) | A 2.4-trillion-parameter mixture of experts, 370 GiB at `UD-Q1_0` | Serving a checkpoint three times larger than the machine's memory, at 11.05 s/token |
| [Qwen3.8 27B](qwen3-8-27b.md) | A 27B dense model | Which quantized arms run, and why block-wise FP8 is CPU-only today |
| [Qwen3.6](qwen3-6.md) | The Qwen3.6 dense and MoE family | Which `lm_head` forms load, and the merged FP8 `in_proj_qkvz` GEMM |
| [Qwen3.5](qwen3-5.md) | The Qwen3.5 Gated DeltaNet family | The `output_gate_type` key, and one load refusal that is about this code |
| [Qwen3-Next](qwen3-next.md) | The Qwen3-Next Gated DeltaNet family | The `output_gate_type` key and its refusals |
| [Nemotron 3.5 Lightning](nemotron-3-5-lightning.md) | A 30B-A3B hybrid of attention, Mamba2, and MoE | Which arms run on the device, which run on the host, and what that costs per token |
| [Muse Glimmer](muse-glimmer.md) | A 30B multimodal model, text with image and video input | Running the text tower from a 17 GB GGUF, and how narrow the verified surface is |
| [Gemma 4](gemma-4.md) | The Gemma 4 family | The ROCm RDNA4 dual-GPU FP8 recipe |

## Speech, music, and video

| Model | What it is | Read the page for |
|---|---|---|
| [IndexTTS 2.5](indextts-2-5.md) | Text to speech, 22.05 kHz mono | Converting the checkpoint and starting a speech-only server |
| [MiniMax-Music3](minimax-music3.md) | Music generation | The checkpoint set and the render command |
| [MiniMax-H3](minimax-h3.md) | Video with audio | The five-file checkpoint set and the render workflow |
| [LTX 2.5](ltx-2-5.md) | Video generation | The checkpoint set, the render command, and what a render costs |

## Speculative decoding

| Model | What it is | Read the page for |
|---|---|---|
| [DSpark](dspark.md) | Draft models for speculative decoding | Which draft layouts run, and which are refused by name |

## What these pages do not carry

A model page records what was measured and what was not. It does not carry the
design rationale for a default or the history of a fixed defect. Those live in
the row's spec under [`.agents/specs/`](../../.agents/specs/), and each page
links to its own.

| You want | Read |
|---|---|
| What is proven and what is not | [Project status](../../README.md#project-status) |
| The complete measurement record | [`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md) |
| Which features, backends, and quantizations exist | [`docs/FEATURES.md`](../FEATURES.md) |
| Every server flag and endpoint | [server reference](../reference/server.md) |
| Every environment knob | [`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`](../ENVIRONMENT.md) |
