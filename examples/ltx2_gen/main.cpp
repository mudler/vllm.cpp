// ltx2-gen — an LTX-2.5 video+audio render, end to end, as a THIN CLIENT of the
// public C ABI (include/vllm.h) and NOTHING else, per the ONE SURFACE directive
// (ARCH-ONE-SURFACE ROW 2). Row MODEL-DIFFUSION-LTX25 phase L9B, issue #435.
//
// WHY A SECOND GENERATION EXAMPLE AND NOT A FLAG ON minimax-h3-gen. The ABI's
// video slice went family-generic at v18: `family` selects the model family and
// two parallel string arrays carry the FAMILY-SPECIFIC load knobs
// (vllm.h:735-747). `minimax-h3-gen` predates that and drives neither, and
// LTX-2.5 CANNOT LOAD without three of them — the audio-stream prompt embeds,
// the DiT config the shipped FP8 checkpoint does not carry, and (for the second
// distilled phase) the latent spatial upsampler. This file exists to name those
// knobs as flags rather than to hand a user a `--extra key=value` grab bag, and
// it is the smallest thing that can drive a real render.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It composes no ffmpeg command line of its own and encodes
// nothing: `vllm_video_mux_argv` builds the argv and this file exec's it, which
// is the ratified process boundary (2026-08-03). It carries no model logic — no
// noise stream, no schedule, no dtype choice — because all of that is the
// library's and a second copy here would be a parallel path.
//
// CONDITIONING HAS TWO SOURCES, and as of phase L13 the first of them is a
// typed prompt. `--encoder` names the Gemma-4 12B text tower and `--prompt`
// carries the words; the tower tokenizes them with its OWN embedded tokenizer,
// runs, projects all 49 hidden states to the two stream widths and hands the
// result to the embeddings connector and then to cross-attention. Before L13
// the tower had no route to the DiT and `--prompt` did not exist here at all.
//
// `--prompt-embeds` + `--audio-prompt-embeds` remain, and remain the only
// conditioning without a tower. Both streams are conditioned or neither:
// LTX-2.5 cross-attends at TWO widths (4096 video, 2048 audio) and one of them
// alone leaves a stream unconditioned, which renders instead of failing.
//
// `--encoder-config` is not optional paperwork. The only shipped LTX-2.5 text
// encoder carries no `__metadata__` at all, so its Gemma config cannot come out
// of the file; the engine refuses rather than defaulting one, because
// `layer_types`, `global_head_dim` and `attention_k_eq_v` resolve a DIFFERENT
// tower out of a byte-identical tensor set.
