/*
 * vllm.h — the vllm.cpp stable C ABI (libvllm).
 *
 * ORIGINAL packaging layer — NOT a 1:1 upstream mirror. vLLM ships no C ABI;
 * this header is the llama.cpp-style (see llama.h) handle-based C surface over
 * the C++ LLMEngine, so downstream FFI consumers (LocalAI via purego/cgo, any
 * C/C++ host) can load + drive vllm.cpp without the C++ headers. Recorded as a
 * deviation in .agents/porting-inventory.md §9 (C-ABI packaging, alongside the
 * vt:: runtime and the cpp-httplib transport).
 *
 * ── ABI contract ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - PURE C: this header compiles as C (C11) and as C++. It uses only C types —
 *   opaque handle typedefs, POD param/result structs, primitive scalars and
 *   `const char*`. No C++ leaks across the boundary.
 * - NO-THROW: every entry point catches all C++ exceptions internally and maps
 *   them to a `vllm_status`; nothing throws across the ABI. On a non-OK status,
 *   `vllm_last_error()` returns a human-readable message (thread-local).
 * - OWNERSHIP is documented per pointer below. In short: the caller frees
 *   heap `char*` returned in results (via vllm_string_free / vllm_completion_free)
 *   and frees engine handles (via vllm_engine_free); `const char*` returns
 *   (finish_reason, vllm_last_error, vllm_version) point to storage the library
 *   owns and the caller must NOT free.
 * - Scope (M3.5 Task 1): load a model + blocking completion. Streaming callback
 *   + sampled generation land in Task 2; the shared/static lib packaging + CLI
 *   + dlopen smoke test in Task 3.

/* ── ABI version ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Bumped on any incompatible change to the structs / signatures below. A
 * consumer can compare this against vllm_abi_version() to detect a mismatch
 * between the header it compiled against and the loaded library.
 * v2: structured-output constraint fields appended to vllm_sampling_params
 * (structured_json / structured_regex / structured_choice / structured_grammar /
 * structured_json_object).
 * v3: OpenAI-style chat entry points (vllm_chat / vllm_chat_stream) — chat
 * templating, tool_choice lowering, and streaming tool-call parsing run
 * ENGINE-SIDE.
 * v4: tool_parser field appended to vllm_model_params — selects the tool-call
 * v5: vllm_model_params.reasoning_parser (chain-of-thought split selection).
 * parser for the chat entry points, or AUTO-detects it from the chat template
 * when NULL/empty.
 * v6: vllm_model_params.speculative_config — the speculative-decoding selection
 * as the JSON object vLLM takes (e.g. '{"method":"mtp"}'); NULL/empty disables
 * speculation (the byte-identical default).
 * v7: vllm_model_params.enable_prefix_caching — tri-state APC toggle
 * (0=model default, 1=on, 2=off). The server's --enable-radix-attention is a
 * documented alias for the ON state (RadixAttention is fused into our APC).
 * v8: vllm_sampling_params.logits_processor / logits_processor_user_data — a
 * per-request custom logits-processor callback (vllm_logits_processor) invoked
 * each decode step to modify the request's logits before sampling. Mirrors
 * vLLM's SamplingParams.logits_processors and SGLang's CustomLogitProcessor.
 * NULL => no processor (the byte-identical default).
 * v9: vllm_model_params.max_num_batched_tokens / scheduling_policy /
 * kv_transfer_config, and tokenizer_config_path is now honoured. These close the
 * gap between what the bundled OpenAI server can configure and what an embedder
 * reaches through this ABI: the chunked-prefill token budget, the scheduler
 * admission policy, and the external KV connector (LMCache `lm://`). Every one is
 * inert at its default, so zero-filling the struct growth keeps the pre-v9
 * engine byte-identical. Malformed speculative_config / kv_transfer_config
 * documents now report VLLM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT (a caller error) rather than
 * VLLM_ERR_MODEL_LOAD, matching what v6 already documented.
 * v10: vllm_model_params.enable_jump_forward — a tri-state toggle for
 * jump-forward decoding (0=default/env-resolved-OFF, 1=on, 2=off), the SGLang
 * grammar-speed subset (ENG-SGLANG-BEHAVIOR-FLAG SW3). Appended at the END of
 * vllm_model_params, after the v9 fields. The VT_ENABLE_JUMP_FORWARD env var,
 * when set, overrides this field. 0 (the default) is the byte-identical
 * default, so zero-filling the struct growth keeps a v9 engine byte-identical.
 * Scheduler policy (incl. SGLang's cache-aware LPM) is selected through the v9
 * string field .scheduling_policy = "lpm" — there is no separate int knob.
 * v11: AUDIO TRANSCRIPTION (ARCH-ONE-SURFACE fold #4) — vllm_transcribe /
 * vllm_transcription_params(_default) / vllm_transcription(_free), appended so
 * zero values preserve behaviour. vllm_engine_load now RESOLVES a
 * transcription-only checkpoint (Parakeet CTC/RNNT/TDT, the vLLM
 * SupportsTranscription mirror) into a transcription engine: the text entry
 * points on such a handle report VLLM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT with an actionable
 * message instead of serving, and vllm_transcribe on a TEXT handle does the
 * same. A pre-v11 caller that never loads a Parakeet directory is
 * byte-identical.
 * v12: VIDEO+AUDIO GENERATION (ARCH-ONE-SURFACE ROW 2, MiniMax-H3) — the
 * ratified video slice: an opaque vllm_video_engine loaded from the H3
 * checkpoint set (vllm_video_engine_load/free, vllm_video_model_params +
 * _default), one blocking vllm_video_generate (vllm_video_params + _default)
 * producing a vllm_video_result (frame dir + WAV + geometry + the ffmpeg argv
 * the CALLER may exec — the library spawns nothing), vllm_video_result_free,
 * and the standalone vllm_video_mux_argv(+_free) composer the mux example
 * client uses. Appended so zero values preserve behaviour; a pre-v12 caller
 * that never touches the video symbols is byte-identical. Text and video
 * handles refuse each other's checkpoints LOUDLY: vllm_video_engine_load on a
 * text-model directory names vllm_engine_load, and vllm_engine_load on an H3
 * checkpoint directory keeps failing exactly as at v11 (no config.json).
 * v13: vllm_complete_tokens — blocking completion from a PRE-TOKENIZED prompt
 * (vLLM's TokensPrompt), returning the generated token ids (and optionally the
 * detokenized vllm_completion). The entry point for embedders that manage
 * their own tokenization and for token-exact gates/benchmarks that compare
 * whole token streams against a reference (the Kimi-Linear paged-runner fold
 * battery, ARCH-ONE-SURFACE ROW 7, is the first consumer). Purely additive —
 * no struct changed.
 * v14: vllm_model_params.device — EXPLICIT DEVICE SELECTION (ARCH-ONE-SURFACE
 * fold ROW 8), the mirror of vLLM's DeviceConfig.device names
 * (vllm/config/device.py:13): 0=auto (the byte-identical default — the
 * accelerator-first platform probe that has always selected the queue), 1=cpu
 * (force the CPU queue even on an accelerator build), 2=cuda (require the
 * CUDA platform; when it is absent the load FAILS with VLLM_ERR_MODEL_LOAD —
 * an explicitly named device is never silently substituted, device.py:61-66).
 * Appended at the END of vllm_model_params so a zero-initialized struct keeps
 * the pre-v14 engine byte-identical.
 * v15: vllm_embed / vllm_embedding_result(_free) — EMBEDDINGS through the ONE
 * surface (ARCH-ONE-SURFACE fold ROW 6). An engine loaded from a POOLING
 * (embedding) checkpoint — a directory whose config.json architectures resolve
 * to a pooling registration, e.g. "LlamaModel" (the mirror of vLLM's
 * _EMBEDDING_MODELS registry.py:230 + as_embedding_model adapters.py:230) —
 * embeds text through the SAME registry forward + PoolingRunner engine step
 * the server's /v1/embeddings drives. Text and pooling handles refuse each
 * other's tasks LOUDLY: vllm_complete/vllm_chat on a pooling engine name
 * vllm_embed, and vllm_embed on a text engine names vllm_complete — the
 * SupportsTranscription-refusal precedent (v11) applied to the pooling task.
 * Purely additive — no struct changed; zero values preserve behaviour.
 *
 * v17 — vllm_server_main: RUN THE OPENAI SERVER from the public surface.
 * examples/server was the deepest ONE SURFACE breach (36 internal headers: the
 * engine, the serving layers, metrics, the video and ASR seams), which is why it
 * carried an example-abi-allowlist entry. That construction moved INTO the
 * library (vllm/entrypoints/openai/server_main.h) and the example is now a thin
 * client of this call. argv rather than a params struct is deliberate: the
 * server takes ~57 flags and gains more with every serving feature, and a
 * mirrored C struct would put that churn in the ABI where every field is
 * permanent. The flag surface mirrors vLLM's cli_args.py, which is the real
 * contract. Embedders wanting programmatic control keep the granular entry
 * points. Purely additive. */
/* v18 — THE GENERALIZED VIDEO SEAM (LTX-2.5 L1, .agents/specs/ltx-2-5.md §5,
 * issue #435). The v12 video slice was H3-typed inside; it is now the C face of
 * vllm::multimodal::VideoEngine, an abstract seam with a checkpoint-detected
 * family registry, so a second video family (LTX-2.5) is an additive file
 * rather than a second ABI. Three additions, all APPENDED:
 *   - vllm_video_model_params.family — the family to load. NULL/empty (the
 *     zero value) means DETECT it from the checkpoint, which is what v12
 *     callers already get, since MiniMax-H3 is what a v12 checkpoint set is.
 *     A name that is not registered is REFUSED naming what is registered; it
 *     is never treated as a hint, and a checkpoint no family claims is refused
 *     rather than handed to the only family present — an H3 DiT loaded as LTX
 *     would not fail, it would render noise.
 *   - extra_keys / extra_values / n_extras on vllm_video_model_params and on
 *     vllm_video_params — parallel arrays carrying FAMILY-SPECIFIC settings as
 *     strings, so a new family adds no permanent field to a struct every other
 *     family must then ignore. n_extras 0 (the zero value) is "none".
 *     vllm_video_model_params.partition is now the documented ALIAS for the
 *     load extra "partition"; supplying both with DIFFERENT values is
 *     VLLM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT rather than a silent winner.
 *   - vllm_video_engine_family() — which family a handle actually resolved to,
 *     so detection is visible to a C caller rather than implicit.
 * A v12 caller is byte-identical: it zero-fills the struct growth, so family
 * stays NULL (detect), n_extras stays 0, `partition` keeps its exact v12
 * meaning, and every v12 status/message contract is unchanged (the
 * text-checkpoint refusal still names vllm_engine_load). */
/* v19 — MULTIMODAL INPUT LIMITS on vllm_model_params (ENG-MM-INPUT-PIPELINE
 * wave L2, issue #607). Two APPENDED fields mirroring vLLM's MultiModalConfig
 * (vllm/config/multimodal.py:78,81) as its own two serve flags expose it
 * (vllm/engine/arg_utils.py:555-556,1276-1279,1691-1692):
 *   - vllm_model_params.language_model_only — the flag whose name misleads and
 *     whose docstring does not: it "disables all multimodal inputs by setting
 *     all modality limits to 0" (multimodal.py:78-80). It is sugar; the limits
 *     are the mechanism.
 *   - vllm_model_params.limit_mm_per_prompt — the per-modality input-count
 *     limits, as the SAME JSON object the flag takes ('{"image": 2,
 *     "video": 0}', or the option form '{"video": {"count": 1}}'), following
 *     the v9 precedent that a dict-valued vLLM flag crosses this ABI as its own
 *     JSON rather than as a fixed struct of modalities the ABI would then owe
 *     forever. A malformed document, a negative count, or an unknown option on
 *     one of the three modalities upstream gives an `extra="forbid"` dataclass
 *     (image/video/audio) fails vllm_engine_load with
 *     VLLM_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT rather than defaulting — mirroring the pydantic
 *     validation upstream does at parse time (multimodal.py:17-45,212-236).
 *     An unknown option on any OTHER modality is dropped, not refused, because
 *     the BaseDummyOptions it falls back to (:17-21,233) is the one such
 *     dataclass declared without extra="forbid".
 * WHERE THEY BITE, stated exactly, because this contract is permanent. Both
 * fields land on the engine's ONE MultiModalConfig
 * (vllm_engine_load -> EngineParams::multimodal -> LoadedEngine::mm_config()),
 * and that config is what BaseProcessingInfo::ValidateNumItems refuses against.
 * The caller that reaches ValidateNumItems on a live request is the OPENAI
 * SERVER: it is the one place that installs the multimodal chat seam
 * (server_main.cpp `chat.set_multimodal_chat_fn(...)`), and serving_chat.cpp
 * gates the whole multimodal branch on that seam being set. So a server started
 * with --language-model-only answers a multimodal chat request with HTTP 400
 * "At most 0 image(s) may be provided in one prompt." rather than serving it.
 *
 * THIS ABI HAS NO MULTIMODAL CHAT REQUEST PATH YET, so on a C-ABI engine the
 * two fields are RECORDED and read by nothing the ABI itself can reach.
 * vllm_chat / vllm_chat_stream never install that seam. A chat request whose
 * content array carries an `image_url` part is therefore answered as TEXT: the
 * part is dropped, its text siblings still form the prompt, no limit is
 * consulted, and language_model_only changes neither the status nor the body.
 * Setting these fields configures the ENGINE — including an OpenAI server built
 * on one — but it does not make a C-ABI chat call refuse an image. Carrying
 * media across this ABI is a later version, and the refusal arm becomes
 * reachable from here only when it lands. That is pinned behaviourally by
 * tests/capi/test_capi.cpp ("capi: the v19 limits are RECORDED on a C-ABI
 * engine; there is no multimodal request path to enforce them on"), so this
 * paragraph cannot silently become false.
 * The memory win upstream also gets from zero limits (skipping the vision tower
 * weights, interfaces.py:293) is NOT in this version — it is wave L3, and until
 * it lands and is MEASURED this field must not be described as freeing VRAM.
 * Appended at the END of vllm_model_params, so a zero-initialized v18 struct is
 * byte-identical: language_model_only 0 (off) and limit_mm_per_prompt NULL (no
 * limits configured => the 999-per-modality default, multimodal.py:331-333). */
/* v20 — SPEECH AND MUSIC GENERATION (.agents/specs/minimax-music3.md §4.1 W6,
 * issue #672). The C face of vllm::multimodal::SpeechEngine, the seam the
 * IndexTTS-2.5 lane landed and MiniMax-Music3 is the first family to implement:
 * an opaque vllm_speech_engine loaded from a checkpoint SET
 * (vllm_speech_engine_load/free, vllm_speech_model_params + _default), one
 * blocking vllm_synthesize (vllm_speech_params + _default) producing a
 * vllm_speech_result — the float waveform AND the RIFF/WAVE bytes, so a server
 * hands a client a playable file without a second encoder — plus
 * vllm_speech_result_free, and three interrogations of the loaded handle
 * (vllm_speech_engine_family / _sample_rate / _requires_reference_audio).
 *
 * WHY THE HANDLE ANSWERS QUESTIONS. `sample_rate` is the family's NATIVE rate
 * (44100 stereo for Music3, 22050 mono for IndexTTS-2.5) and never a resampled
 * one, so the caller decides whether to resample.
 * `requires_reference_audio` exists so a server can REFUSE a request before
 * staging tens of gigabytes: true for a family with no text-only synthesis,
 * false for one conditioned on text alone.
 *
 * A MUSIC family takes TWO texts. `lyrics` and `description` are separate
 * fields rather than one `text` behind a separator, because upstream runs a
 * DIFFERENT normalizer over each (encoders.py:54-91); a one-utterance family
 * keeps using `text` and ignores them. Every generation control is inert at its
 * zero value, which selects the family's own default — EXCEPT `guidance_scale`,
 * which carries `has_guidance_scale` beside it (the vllm_video_params.has_seed
 * precedent) because 0 IS A LEGAL GUIDANCE SCALE and a 0-means-default sentinel
 * would make the unconditional branch unreachable.
 *
 * Purely additive: no struct changed, no existing signature moved, and a pre-v19
 * caller that never touches a speech symbol is byte-identical. A directory no
 * speech family claims is refused NAMING every family that was tried, because
 * the wrong family does not fail, it renders noise. */
/* v21 — vllm_speech_model_params.device + vllm_speech_engine_device, THE SPEECH
 * LANE'S DEVICE SELECTOR (issue #672). v20 could only run a speech family on the
 * CPU: MiniMax-Music3's queue was a compile-time constant, so a 28.5 GB music
 * model was a host-only model whatever hardware the box had.
 *
 * 0 = CPU, 1 = the accelerator this build resolves. That is the
 * vllm_video_model_params.device spelling, NOT vllm_model_params.device's
 * 0=auto/1=cpu/2=cuda: the text engine's `auto` selects an accelerator when one
 * exists, whereas a speech family's CPU path is what its correctness gates were
 * taken on, so a ZERO-VALUE CALLER MUST KEEP GETTING THE CPU ARM. Device 1 on a
 * build with no accelerator backend, or on a PARTIAL backend that declines the
 * family's architecture, is REFUSED BY NAME at load rather than substituted.
 *
 * vllm_speech_engine_device reports what was GRANTED, not what was asked for —
 * two different facts, and a benchmark that conflates them measures the CPU arm
 * twice.
 *
 * Appended at the END of vllm_speech_model_params, so a zero-initialized v20
 * struct keeps the CPU engine byte-identical. WHAT DEVICE 1 MOVES for Music3 is
 * the 8.6B language model and nothing else yet; the RVQ depth decoder and the
 * acoustic half are still host reference loops (see docs/FEATURES.md). */
/* v22 — vllm_model_params.mmproj_path, THE SECOND GGUF FILE (row
 * `LOAD-GGUF-MMPROJ`, issue #821). A GGUF multimodal model ships as two files:
 * the language `.gguf` and a `clip`-architecture `mmproj-*.gguf` carrying the
 * vision tower. Before this field the ABI could name only the first, so a GGUF
 * multimodal checkpoint could be loaded only as a text model and the projector
 * had nowhere to arrive.
 *
 * The spelling mirrors llama.cpp's user-facing `--mmproj`, which is the flag
 * every holder of these artifacts already types. It is EXPLICIT by design:
 * auto-discovery of a sibling `mmproj*.gguf` is deliberately not implemented,
 * because a directory holding two unrelated models would then silently fuse
 * them and the failure would be a wrong-shaped model rather than an error.
 *
 * SCOPE, and it carries the same weight as the field: this loads the tower and
 * hands it to the engine. THIS ABI STILL HAS NO MULTIMODAL REQUEST PATH, so
 * `vllm_chat` / `vllm_generate` cannot yet feed the tower an image — exactly
 * the state the v19 note above records for the multimodal limits. What the
 * field buys today is that the projector is READ, VALIDATED and REFUSED BY
 * NAME at load instead of being unnameable.
 *
 * Appended at the END of vllm_model_params, so a zero-initialized v21 struct is
 * byte-identical: NULL/empty means no projector, which is every load that
 * existed before. */

/* v23 — vllm_video_last_phase_log, WHERE A RENDER SPENT ITS WALL (issue #1010,
 * row LTX25-DEVICE-RESIDENCY stage W0).
 *
 * Before this the LTX-2.5 render path emitted one line per render, so a render
 * that took two hours could not say which of its phases took them. Every
 * attempt to act on that profile has since failed on a measurement defect: the
 * evidence existed only on a host that stopped answering (#1040), the 1731 s
 * phase #1087 measures is unnamed, and #1024's GPU-zero window is known to be
 * neither the denoise nor the decode.
 *
 * A completed generation now WRITES a phase table — `phase-log.json`, beside
 * the frames, on the shipped default and behind no flag — carrying, per phase,
 * a monotone timestamp, a duration, a peak host byte count and a peak device
 * byte count, plus the wall and the `unaccounted_seconds` the named phases did
 * NOT cover. That residue is emitted rather than smeared over the phases,
 * because a table whose parts do not add up has a phase nobody named.
 *
 * PURELY ADDITIVE: no struct changed and no existing signature moved, which is
 * why the path is a QUERY on the handle rather than a new member on
 * vllm_video_result. Growing an OUTPUT struct is the one append a caller cannot
 * absorb by zero-initializing, since the library writes the field with its own
 * sizeof. A family that emits no table returns NULL.
 *
 * IT IS v23 AND IT WAS WRITTEN AS v22. `vllm_model_params.mmproj_path` (issue
 * #821) took v22 on `main` while this branch was open, and both features had
 * merged into a tree that defined 22 twice. Two additions under one version is
 * not a textual conflict a merge tool resolves — the number is the caller's only
 * question ("does the library I loaded have this?"), and one that answers yes
 * for a feature the build does not carry is worse than no version at all. So
 * this one moved. The dependent sites moved with it: the >= floor in
 * `tests/capi/test_capi.cpp`, the table row and the version line in
 * `docs/USAGE.md`, and the surface row in `docs/FEATURES.md`. */
