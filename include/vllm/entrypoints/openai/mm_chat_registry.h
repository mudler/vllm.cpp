// The per-ARCHITECTURE multimodal chat seam registry (ENG-MM-INPUT-PIPELINE,
// issue #2475).
//
// Ported from: vllm/multimodal/registry.py @ 5559679229bc — the mechanism vLLM
// uses to resolve a multimodal processor for a model:
//   * :81-95   `_ProcessorFactories` + `build_processor`, the per-model record;
//   * :142-172 `register_processor`, the decorator that attaches that record TO
//              THE MODEL CLASS, i.e. keys it on the architecture;
//   * :176-186 `_get_model_cls`, which resolves
//              `get_model_architecture(model_config)` and RAISES BY NAME —
//              "Model class {name} has no registered multimodal processor" —
//              rather than substituting another model's factory;
//   * :211-230 `create_processor`, the dispatch;
//   * :103-139 `supports_multimodal_inputs`, the predicate: the model is
//              multimodal AND a processor is registered for it. Its
//              missing-processor arm logs `warning_once` naming the model and
//              runs text-only.
// Qwen3-VL's own registration sits on the model in one place and edits no shared
// table (`qwen3_vl.py:1673-1678`).
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. The server used to decide whether it could serve images by
// asking whether `<model_dir>/preprocessor_config.json` existed, and then
// constructed `Qwen3VLImageProcessor` + `MakeQwen3VLImageChatFn`
// unconditionally: no branch on the architecture anywhere in the block.
// `preprocessor_config.json` is not a Qwen3-VL marker, so a second multimodal
// checkpoint got Qwen3-VL's processor read against its own `vision_config`
// shape, or threw into a swallowed `catch` and left the server silently on the
// text-only path. A multimodal model that answers an image request as though it
// were text looks like a working server, which is why the silent arm is the
// worse one (#2475).
//
// WHY HERE AND NOT ON `ModelFactory`. `ModelFactory` already carries this
// model's mm-FORWARD hooks (`encode_mm` / `embed_mm`,
// model_registry.h:761-767), so a chat-seam field beside them is the obvious
// mirror. It is the wrong layer: the artefact a chat factory produces is
// `MultiModalChatFn`, and building one needs `ChatPromptRenderFn`,
// `ImageCodecFn`, `ChatMessage` and `BaseProcessingInfo`, all of which live in
// `entrypoints/openai`. Putting them on `ModelFactory` makes `model_executor`
// depend on `entrypoints`. Upstream has the same split for the same reason: the
// registered artefact is a `BaseMultiModalProcessor` from `vllm/multimodal/`,
// and `serving_chat.py` carries no per-model registration at all. So the
// registry lives beside what it produces and is keyed on the same architecture
// string `ModelRegistry` resolves.
//
// The self-registration idiom is `REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL`'s
// (model_registry.h:939-976), deliberately: a TU-static registrar whose
// constructor registers, reached through the `vllm` static library's INTERFACE
// `--whole-archive` (CMakeLists.txt:1446-1453). Adding a model is a new
// translation unit with one line and ZERO edits to a shared array.
