// The keying and the file I/O live here, apart from the device reads, so a test

// (`DumpTensor`, `MaybeDumpStream`) stay beside the forward in qwen3_5.cpp,
// where the `Dev`/`DBuf` glue is.

// ─── ROCM-TIER-DIVERGENCE (#2590): the activation-dump writer ────────────────
//
// Every env-gated activation dump in the qwen3.5 dense paged forward goes through
// `actdump`. It exists
// because three dumps were already in that file and none of them could support the
// comparison #2590 needs, for reasons that were invisible in their output:
//
//   * A FAILED OPEN WROTE NOTHING AND SAID NOTHING. Each writer was
//     `if (f != nullptr) { fwrite; fclose; }`, so a dump into a directory that
//     does not exist is byte-for-byte the same experience as a dump that was
//     never switched on. That is the failure `.agents/verification.md` names
//     ("an instrument that writes nothing looks exactly like an instrument that
//     is off"), and the sibling logit-dump row burned a lease on exactly it.
//     Here every open, write and close is a VT_CHECK carrying the knob, the
//     path and errno, so a silent skip is now a refusal by name.
//   * NOTHING RECORDED WHAT WAS DUMPED. The blobs were raw bytes with no dtype,
//     shape or provenance, so a reader had to infer the element width from the
//     file size and two dumps of different dtypes compared as garbage without
//     either side saying so. Every blob now files a `manifest.tsv` row, and the
//     comparator joins on it rather than on a naming convention.
//   * THE KEY WAS AN INVOCATION ORDINAL. `RunDenseLayerPaged`'s sub-stage dump
//     keyed its files on a `static thread_local` counter that is never reset, so
//     one extra forward call on either side silently shifts the whole join. The
//     key is now (step, layer), taken explicitly.
//
// Debug-only on both knobs: each blob costs a Download, which synchronizes. A
// capture path must never set either variable.
namespace actdump {

// The two knobs, read ONCE. `VT_DUMP_ACT` is the residual-stream dump (both
// halves, per layer); `VT_DUMP_ACT_SUB` is the per-layer sub-stage dump. Both
// are pre-existing names and both already sit on scripts/env-doc-allowlist.txt,

// reads this instead of keeping a counter of its own, which is what stops two
