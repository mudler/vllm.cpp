// (dense_nvfp4_gemm.h) can sit BENEATH the attention block that consumes them

// dense_nvfp4_gemm.h, which would otherwise be an include cycle. The definitions
// below are byte-for-byte the dense_attn_block.h originals and stay in the SAME

// Contents (all `vllm::dense_attn`):

//   MakeTensor / Reshape    — non-owning strided views.
//   DevicePoolPolicy        — platform residency policy for the scratch pool.
//   DBuf                    — move-only pooled device allocation + tensor view.

// translation units under `src/vllm/model_executor/models/` include, and as a
// private twin in `qwen3_5.cpp` that stays private on purpose (`:790`). Both
// carried the same defect, so a repair applied once left it standing. This is
// the body both now install through, and it is the reason there is one repair
// rather than two.
//
// WHY `f` IS TAKEN BY VALUE AND NAMED. It is the copy SOURCE, and its lifetime
// is the entire bug. `Backend::Copy` is ASYNCHRONOUS on both device backends --
// `cudaMemcpyAsync` (`src/vt/cuda/cuda_backend.cu:116-118`) and `hipMemcpyAsync`
// (`src/vt/rocm/rocm_backend.hip:269-271`) -- and this source is ordinary
// PAGEABLE heap memory, which the driver may read at any point until the queue
// drains. Both callers used to build it in a function-local vector and let it
// die at their closing brace, with nothing in between that drained anything.
//
// THE `Synchronize` IS THE FIX, and the tree already states its rule for the
// same hazard: `glm5_next_kv.cpp:143-150` drains on EVERY span rather than once
// at the end, because a deferred wait "would hand the driver a pageable source
// that the next iteration has already overwritten." Same hazard, now handled the
// same way.
//
// WHY NOT KEEP THE SOURCE ALIVE INSTEAD. `vt::Backend` has no completion
// callback and nothing polls `Event`, so "alive until the copy retires"
// degenerates to "alive for the model's lifetime" -- a permanent host allocation
// per upcast weight, reinstating exactly the second host copy
// `AdoptDeviceBytesAsHost` and `ReleaseResidentQwen3_5DenseHostWeights` exist to
// drop. The drain is memoised on `d_dev_f32`, so it runs ONCE per distinct
// weight per process rather than per forward or per token.
//
// THE SIBLING `ResidentWeight` DOES NOT DRAIN, AND IS RIGHT NOT TO. Its source
// is `w.bytes`, an owned buffer or a file mapping that outlives the call. The
// asymmetry between the two helpers is the whole defect, not an oversight in
// the other one.
