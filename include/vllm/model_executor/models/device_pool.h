// Shared process-wide caching device allocator (DevicePool) — extracted VERBATIM
// from the Qwen3.6 forward (qwen3_5.cpp) so the dense Qwen3 forward (qwen3.cpp)
// reuses the SAME pooled-scratch machinery instead of raw per-op Backend
// Alloc/Free. The relocation was byte-for-byte the qwen3_5.cpp definitions; what
// has changed since is that a pool is now bound to ONE DEVICE (see below), and
// the accessors take the backend that names it.
//
// Rationale: both cudaMalloc AND cudaFree SYNCHRONIZE the whole device, so the
// per-op DBuf alloc/free churn in a forward (thousands of tiny scratch buffers per
// step) is itself a sync storm. This pool reuses freed blocks (size-class keyed)
// instead of hitting cudaMalloc/cudaFree, so after a brief warm-up almost every
// DBuf lifetime is sync-free. Reuse is safe under the forward's single-queue
// (single-stream) ordering: a block returned to the pool is only handed back out
// on the same queue, and CUDA stream ordering guarantees the op that last touched
// the block has completed before any reused op runs — no host sync needed. Blocks
// are never returned to the driver (leak at process exit, like the cublasLt
// workspace); the pool is bounded by the forward's peak concurrent scratch.
//
// ONE POOL PER DEVICE (#516, .agents/specs/pool-device-key.md). Until this was
// fixed there was ONE pool for the whole process and its free list was keyed by
// byte size class alone, so a block allocated through one backend was handed to
// the next caller of that size class whatever device it was running on. One
// fault, two symptoms, chosen by direction: a cudaMalloc block reaching a
// CPU-backend forward SIGSEGVs host-side (and compute-sanitizer is CLEAN,
// because the fault is not on the device), while a host block reaching a CUDA
// forward returned a UNIFORM 0x7fff0000 quiet NaN — computed and propagated, not
// garbage read. vLLM never had the bug because it never had the design: its
// allocation handle carries the device as field 0
// (vllm/device_allocator/__init__.py:12-14 @ pin 555967922) and torch's cache is
// per-device by construction (c10/cuda/CUDACachingAllocator.h:118-172).
//
// So a `DevicePool` is BOUND to one backend, `Pool(b)` resolves the pool for a
// device, and there is deliberately NO way to spell "the pool" without naming a
// device. The `vt::Backend*` IS the device identity: the registry hands out
// exactly one Backend* per Device{type,index} (vt/backend.h, kMaxDevicesPerType),
// and GetBackend(type) and GetBackend(Device{type,0}) return the identical
// pointer — so the device enters the key with no new virtual on vt::Backend and
// therefore no edit to any backend implementation.

// --- Aux-stream scratch pool (ENG-MOE-SHARED-AUX) ----------------------------
// The MoE shared-expert overlap (MoeBlockFusedMarlinCuda) issues the shared MLP
// on a SECOND CUDA stream concurrent with the routed experts on the main stream.
// The main `Pool()` above is only reuse-safe under SINGLE-stream ordering: a
// block returned to the free list is handed back out on the same stream, so CUDA
// stream ordering guarantees the block's last op has completed before any reuse.
// Two streams sharing one pool BREAKS that invariant — a scratch block the aux
// stream freed (e.g. the shared gate/up transient) could be handed to a routed
// GEMM on the main stream and written WHILE the aux kernel still reads it (a
// cross-stream RAW/WAR race compute-sanitizer flags). vLLM sidesteps this with
// its STREAM-AWARE caching allocator (record_stream); we keep the simple pool and
// instead give the aux stream its OWN pool. Each pool then only ever serves ONE
// stream, so single-stream ordering holds within it and the two streams never
// share a live block. Blocks are handed back to the pool they came from (DBuf
// stores its owning pool), so a buffer allocated in the aux region and destroyed
// after the join still returns to the aux pool.
// The aux pool is per-device too: the stream distinction and the device
// distinction are independent, and a process with two devices running the MoE
// overlap needs one aux pool per device, not one shared between them.
