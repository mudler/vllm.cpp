// MLA latent, the sliding-window cache, the indexer key cache and two compressor
// states — and a position cannot say which of them it is.

// `attn_group_ids_`, which collects only the groups whose spec is an
// `AttentionSpec`, so a `MambaSpec` group's layers were never named at all:
// their states reached the forward through `gdn_state` POSITIONALLY, and
// `Find()` answered -1 for every one of them. DeepSeek-V4 hid this, because it
// publishes only MLA / SlidingWindowMLA specs and all 167 of its caches are
// attention ones. Both three-group hybrids do not: `qwen4_exp` and `glm5_next`
// each carry a `MambaSpec`, and #2343 measured the consequence as
// `22 KV cache(s) from 2 published group(s)` reported beside
// `block tables gathered for 3 of 3` — 34 recurrent states invisible while
// their group's block table was not.
//
// THE ORDER IS UPSTREAM'S INSERTION ORDER: published GROUP order, then that
// group's own `layer_names` order, which is exactly how
// `_reshape_kv_cache_tensors` fills its dict
// (`vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py:7365-7372`,
// `for group in ...: for layer_name in group.layer_names`). A recurrent group
// between two attention groups therefore sits BETWEEN them here, and an entry's

// `attn_kv[(*payload_slots)[i]]` when its kind is `kPaged` and

// methods through two protocols, and the runner code is generic over them:
//
//   SupportsMultiModal.embed_multimodal      -> the vision/audio tower
//   SupportsMultiModal.embed_input_ids       -> embed ids + splice the mm rows
//   SupportsMRoPE.get_mrope_input_positions  -> the 3-D prompt positions
//
// `ModelRegistry` is type-erased over `LoadedModel`, so a Python protocol
// becomes three optional function pointers on `ModelFactory`. All three default
// null, and `GPUModelRunner` runs its multimodal path only when the first two
// are set AND some request in the step carries mm_features — so a text model
// and a text step are byte-identical.

// WHY DEEPSTACK IS NOT IN THIS SEAM. `grep -c deepstack` over upstream's

// tower output and are unpacked model-side into a model-owned buffer
// (`qwen3_vl.py:1757 self.deepstack_input_embeds`, the ctor one of two,
// discriminated by its `# register buffer for deepstack` comment). A runner
// that knew about DeepStack would be a runner that knows about one

  // failure it prevents is INVISIBLE. A model that discards a name-keyed set
  // decodes by recomputing the whole prefix, which keeps the tokens right
  // while doing asymptotically more work, so no token gate can see it. A

  // and another that does not is a defect in that forward, and this bit cannot
  // see it. Setting it is a statement about the code, not a warrant for it.

  // NAMED `forward` (ENG-MM-EMBED-DEVICE-IDS,
  // [#2730](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/2730)). A multimodal
  // registration can resolve the step's identifiers in its `embed_mm` hook and
  // hand the forward merged embeds instead, in which case the forward reads no
  // identifier at all and the registration is still correct. `qwen3_vl` is that
  // case and is the only one today: its forward REFUSES a step without
  // `input.mm` by name, and the runner only ever supplies `mm` from the same
  // branch that just called `ModelRegistry::EmbedMm` with the same device
  // pointer, so every step it can reach came through the hook. Leaving this
  // comment saying "forward" while a registration sets it on the strength of its
  // embed is how a capability bit becomes a lie, so it says both. The HOOK's own

  //
  // THIS IS NOT A PREFERENCE, IT IS THE ONLY THING BETWEEN A SERVER AND A DEAD
  // ENGINE. A forward that refuses `num_reqs > 1` throws from inside the
  // EngineCore busy loop, and that loop treats a throw as FATAL: the process
  // keeps its socket open, every in-flight request gets a 500 naming the model,
  // and every later request gets the same. MEASURED on this architecture at
  // `--max-num-seqs 4` before this bit existed — three concurrent

  // "EngineCore encountered an issue ... this forward serves ONE sequence per

  // every weight on the device, which is a memory bug with no error anywhere.
  //
  // Declaring the capability makes that case LOUD instead: the engine refuses a
  // configured offload against a model that does not claim support, naming the
  // architecture. A new model inherits false and is refused until someone wires
  // it, which is the same polarity as the `-Werror=switch` totality proof in

  // at a time out of the host slot store instead of being staged.
  //
  // THE DEFAULT IS FALSE FOR THE SAME REASON `supports_weight_offload`'s is, and
  // this one is load-bearing in the UNSAFE direction. The load-time fit bound
  // (`gguf_device_fit.h`) can drop a tensor set from what it charges the device,
  // and the loader identifies that set by NAME — `_exps.weight`, which is what a
  // llama.cpp MoE export writes for every MoE family it converts, not only the
  // ones this tree streams. `deepseek_v4_weights.cpp` and `laguna_weights.cpp`
  // both write that exact suffix, and neither model composes `RunMoeBlock`
  // (`deepseek_v2.cpp` says so at its head), so neither ever reaches

  // be a second description of the same fact, in a file that cannot see when the
  // first one changes — and a model whose forward stopped streaming would leave

  // topology in silence and reports a decode rate for a full-recompute path --
  // and, for a paged model, re-attends an empty prefix on every step after the
  // first, which is fluent wrong text and not a crash.
  //
  // WHY THE CAPABILITY AND NOT AN ARCHITECTURE LIST, which is the same argument
