// Exposed entry point for the file-static Gated DeltaNet (GDN) linear-attention
// block that lives in the anonymous namespace of
// src/vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3_5.cpp (`GdnBlockPaged` @ the Qwen3.5/3.6
// paged decoder layer, over vt::CausalConv1d*/vt::GdnDecode/vt::GdnSpecDecode).
//
// The Qwen3.5/3.6 forward (`RunLayerPaged` / the dense paged layer) calls
// `GdnBlockPaged` internally, but a NEW hybrid architecture — Qwen4-Exp
// (`Qwen4ExpLayerKind::kLinearAttention`, 36 of its 48 layers, row
// MODEL-MM-QWEN4-EXP W5b) — must reuse the SAME block from a DIFFERENT
// translation unit. `GdnBlockPaged` has INTERNAL LINKAGE — it sits in the one
// anonymous namespace that spans most of qwen3_5.cpp — and the obstacle to
// simply giving it external linkage and declaring it here is `StepDevInputs`,
// which is declared inside that same anonymous namespace and so can be named by
// no header.
//
// `Dev` and `DBuf` are NOT part of that obstacle, and an earlier draft of this
// comment said they were. It repeated a claim from `qwen3_5_moe_block.h` next
// door that was true when that header was written and has not been true since:
// both types are `vllm::dense_attn::Dev` / `DBuf` from the PUBLIC
// `dense_device_glue.h`, and qwen3_5.cpp merely `using`-imports them
// (`using dense_attn::Dev;` / `using dense_attn::DBuf;`). `ENG-HYBRID-PLACEMENT`
// (`f730eb11c`, #2046) is what replaced qwen3_5.cpp's private copies with the
// shared ones. The seam case in
// `tests/vllm/models/test_qwen3_5_gdn_spec_routing.cpp` constructs a
// `vllm::dense_attn::Dev` and a `DBuf` from a foreign translation unit, which is
// the executable form of that correction. The conclusion is unchanged — this
// seam still needs a wrapper — but the reason is `StepDevInputs` alone.
//
// This header therefore mirrors the `RunMoeBlock` precedent next door
// (qwen3_5_moe_block.h), which exists for the identical reason: a thin public
// wrapper over primitive vt:: types. `RunGdnBlockPaged` builds the `Dev`,
// calls `GdnBlockPaged`, and hands back the block's device buffer as an
// owning `GdnBlockOutput` whose deleter returns the pool block to the shared
// DevicePool (the same `WrapDeviceLogits` release pattern `MoeBlockOutput`
// uses). The Qwen3.5/3.6 path is UNTOUCHED and byte-identical — this only ADDS
// a second caller; there is exactly one GDN implementation and both callers run
// it.
//
// WHY THE STEP INPUTS ARE A SEPARATE HANDLE. `StepDevInputs` is the per-step
// device upload of positions / slot_mapping / block_table / seq_lens /
// query_start_loc / the GDN state-index tensors, and qwen3_5.cpp builds it ONCE
// PER STEP and shares it across every layer precisely so those uploads do not
// repeat per layer ("ONE upload per input, per step", qwen3_5.cpp). A wrapper
// that rebuilt it inside each block call would reinstate exactly the per-layer
// upload that was removed, 36 times per step on this architecture. So the build
// is its own public call returning an opaque owning handle (the same
// `shared_ptr<void>` idiom `MoeBlockOutput::storage` uses to keep an internal
// type out of this header), and the composing forward keeps it alive for the
// whole layer loop, exactly as `RunLayerPaged`'s caller does.
