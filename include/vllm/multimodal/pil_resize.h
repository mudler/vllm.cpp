// Pillow's `Image.Resampling.BICUBIC` resize, ported for the uint8 RGB images a
// multimodal chat request carries.
//
// Ported from Pillow `src/libImaging/Resample.c` at tag `12.1.1`:
//   bicubic_filter (a = -0.5, support = 2.0)          :46-61
//   PRECISION_BITS / _clip8_lookups / clip8           :88-96, :735-741
//   precompute_coeffs                                 :98-165 (numbering as read)
//   normalize_coeffs_8bpc                             :167-181
//   ImagingResampleHorizontal_8bpc (bands == 3)       :183-...
//   ImagingResampleVertical_8bpc  (bands == 3)
//   ImagingResampleInner                              (two-pass driver)
//
// WHY A FILE OF ITS OWN, AND WHY THE NAME SAYS "PIL". This is NOT "a bicubic
// kernel", and it is NOT torchvision's bicubic. Two things separate it from
// both, and they only matter on a DOWNSCALE, which is what a chat request
// almost always asks for:
//
//   * the filter SUPPORT is scaled by `max(1, in/out)`, so a 5x downscale reads
//     a 21-tap window and behaves as a weighted area average rather than as a
//     four-tap interpolation, and
//   * the weights are normalized PER OUTPUT PIXEL, and the whole thing runs in
//     22-bit fixed point over a uint8 INTERMEDIATE image between the two passes.
//
// A naive four-tap cubic disagrees with this badly on any real downscale, and
// nothing about the disagreement is visible to a shape check or to a token
// count. `qwen3vl_processor.cpp` defers a resize of its own and names
// TORCHVISION bicubic (`antialias=False`, no support scaling, float output with
// no uint8 round trip). That is a different algorithm; this function does not
// discharge that debt.
