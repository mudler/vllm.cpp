// vllm.cpp original (vt runtime, inventory deviation §9.1) — the ACCELERATION
// PROVIDER seam (BACKEND-ACCEL-PROVIDER, .agents/specs/metal-mlx-reuse-study.md
// §6, work row W0b-2).
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `src/vt/ops.cpp` keyed exactly ONE `void*` per
// (OpId, DeviceType) and `RegisterOp` overwrote it with no check and no warning.
// Two implementations of one op on one device therefore could not coexist: which
// one you got depended on static-initialization order ACROSS translation units,
// which the standard leaves unspecified. "Register MLX's matmul alongside our
// MSL matmul" was a NONDETERMINISTIC BUILD, not a configuration. That is the bug
// this header fixes; MLX is merely the first caller.
//
// THE SEAM. This generalizes `src/vt/cuda/cuda_arch_tactics.h` — which already
// had every property the op table lacked — up one layer, out of `vt::cuda`, and
// keys it on (OpId, DeviceType):
//   * capacity-bounded static storage, registration is TABLE FILL ONLY and never
//     throws or allocates, so it is safe from any static-init order;
//   * a capability predicate (`supports`) evaluated against a DEVICE-NEUTRAL
//     `ProviderCaps` — the one genuine CUDA coupling of the tactic registry
//     (`DeviceCaps`) generalized away;
//   * a portable FALLBACK: a provider that cannot handle a particular call
//     declines and forwards to the next provider down (`GetOpFallback`), which
//     is the `ArchTacticLaunchFn`-returns-false axis expressed at this layer;
//   * SELECTION IS OBSERVABLE (`GetOpProviderStats`, `VT_OP_PROVIDER_STATS=1`),
//     because a passing test does not prove WHICH provider executed;
//   * SELECTION IS DETERMINISTIC — see below.
//
// DETERMINISM (the actual defect, stated precisely). Selection order is
// `(priority DESC, name ASC)` with `name` compared by `strcmp`. Both keys are
// compile-time constants of the registering TU, so the selected provider is a
// pure function of WHICH providers are linked in — never of the order their
// static initializers happened to run. Registering the same `name` twice for one
// (OpId, DeviceType) is a programming error and is rejected (first wins), so the
// order is also a strict total order. `tests/vt/test_op_provider.cpp` asserts
// this by registering providers in both orders and requiring the same winner.
//
// RECONCILIATION WITH `.agents/specs/dropin-kernel-abi.md` (BACKEND-ABI-VT).
// That spec is the ARGUMENT half of a provider seam: how a raw-C launcher
// (CUTLASS/Marlin/cuBLASLt/flashinfer) receives pointers, shapes, strides,
// semantic types, workspace and stream. It is deliberately silent on WHICH
// launcher runs. This header is the SELECTION half and is deliberately silent on
// the argument shape — `OpProvider::fn` is the same type-erased `void*` the op
// table always held, so a drop-in adapter registered through `RegisterTypedOp`
// is a provider like any other. They compose; neither replaces the other.
//
// FOUR BACKENDS, ONE MECHANISM (the test the user set for this design):
//   * Metal  — MLX (`steel_matmul`/`qmm`), a C++ OBJECT-MODEL library; the shape
//              `dropin-kernel-abi.md` cannot express, and the reason this exists.
//   * CUDA   — cuBLASLt / CUTLASS / flashinfer / Marlin: raw C launchers whose
//              ARGUMENTS come from `dropin-kernel-abi.md` and whose SELECTION
//              comes from here; `supports()` reads `ProviderCaps::compute_major`.
//   * Vulkan — llama.cpp-style coopmat/coopmat2 shader tactics, selected on
//              `ProviderCaps::features` bits published by the Vulkan context.
//   * CPU    — llama.cpp `vec_dot`/repack tiers, selected on ISA feature bits.
// It is not an MLX seam. MLX is one row.

// Vulkan: a skeleton) could not run a model at all. This is our equivalent of
// `forward_native`: register the existing CPU kernel as a NEGATIVE-priority
// provider on a UNIFIED-MEMORY device, so an op the device lacks a native kernel
// for falls back to the CPU reference instead of throwing.
//
// SAFETY (the load-bearing invariant). A CPU kernel dereferences host pointers.
// That is correct ONLY where host and device memory alias (Metal StorageMode-
// Shared, GB10 / integrated Vulkan, CPU) — `Backend::UnifiedMemory()`. On a
// DISCRETE GPU a CPU kernel reading a device pointer is memory corruption, so the
// tier is gated on the unified-memory property, never on DeviceType blindly.
//
// DETERMINISM / no-change-on-native. The fallback registers at
// kReferenceTierPriority (strictly below every native kernel's priority >= 0), so
// a native kernel always wins when present — a backend that HAS the kernel is
// byte-identical to before. And the tier installs LAZILY, only on a genuine
