# The record gates are cheap, deterministic and CPU-only, but they were spread

# A session declares a role, and an UNDECLARED one is a failing gate by default:
# the obligation used to live in prose and in an opt-in flag, and neither fired.
# read-only passes a plain run and fails --staged, because staging is writing.
#
# --role-only exists so the mutation suite can EXECUTE that gate instead of
# grepping it: text assertions catch a REWRITE of the default and miss an
# OVERRIDE on a later line. A nested FULL run is impossible -- this script runs
# the very suite that would call it, so it would recurse without bound -- hence
# a mode that runs the role block and stops. It is not an opt-out: it checks the
# ROLE strictly, which --no-require-role does not, and it never prints the "All
# gates green." banner, because it skips every record gate and mutation suite
# --no-require-role runs and so has not earned it. Neither mode is a superset of
# the other; --role-only is narrower and stricter, and says so on stdout.
#
# Every gate reports one of THREE states. `ok` ran and passed, `FAIL` ran and
# failed, `SKIP` did not run and says why. "All gates green." needs an empty
# FAIL list AND an empty SKIP list, because a banner over a block that never
# executed is a false report rather than a weaker gate (#998).
#
# The exit status carries only TWO of those states, so a SKIP still exits 0 and
# a reader who wants the third has to read the report. That is right for a human
# on a branch behind main and wrong for a program: `scripts/agent-ready.py` read
# preflight by exit code alone and called a run with two unexecuted trailer gates
# "green". --fail-on-skip is the opt-in for a machine consumer -- it exits 1 when
# anything was skipped, and it does not change what any gate demands or what a
# plain run reports. Ask for it when a skip must not read as success.
#
# It writes NOTHING into the source tree. The compile gate below configures a
# CMake build directory under the system temporary directory and removes it
# again, because reading a build's real flags is the only way to compile with
# them; nothing else here writes at all. It is still always safe to run.

branch, then rerun. Unknown is not absence."

# The other two questions about the pinned base, asked ONCE and beside the pin,
# with the git exit status kept rather than collapsed.
#
# `--is-ancestor` answers 1 for "no" and 128 for "that question cannot be asked
# here" -- an unborn HEAD (`git checkout --orphan`) is one way to reach it. Both
# used to take the same arm, so the report named a cause ("is not an ancestor of
# HEAD") that was not the cause.
#
# `rev-list --count` used to be spelled `|| echo 0`, which filed a FAILED count
# under the deliberate empty-range exemption of §3.6. An empty range withholds
# nothing and keeps the banner. A count that could not be taken withholds
# everything and must not. Mapping the second onto the first is the same
# unknown-as-success conflation this row exists to remove.
#
# The count keeps stderr OUT of its value, and the value is then validated. The
# repair for `|| echo 0` was first written as `2>&1`, which reintroduced the very
# defect through a narrower door: git can write to stderr AND exit 0, so the
# status catches nothing while the value carries the error text ahead of the
# number. `[ "$RANGE_COUNT" -gt 0 ]` does not evaluate false there, it ERRORS
# with status 2, which reads as false, and both range blocks fell through to
# their empty-range arm while "All gates green." printed over five dropped
# gates. A `.git/objects/info/alternates` naming a path that does not exist is
# one way to reach it: `error: unable to normalize alternate object path: ...`
# on stderr, the count on stdout, exit 0.
#
# Discarding stderr is what makes the VALUE right, and it is also what keeps a
# git that merely warns from costing five gates a SKIP it does not deserve.
# Validating the value is what makes an arm exist at all for a count that is not
# a count: without it, any non-numeric value reaches `-gt` and its status-2 error
# is indistinguishable from "zero commits". The two halves cover different
# failures, so both are here.
#
# Discarding stderr also had a COST, and the cost is paid separately rather than
# argued away. `2>/dev/null` threw the message away along with its influence on
# the value, so an unborn HEAD reported "exited 128 and printed [] on stdout"
# while git had already named the cause in one line. That report is honest and
# not actionable, and this row owes both. The rule is message-NOT-a-value, not

# THE BENCHMARK-TOOL SUITES, which PREFLIGHT never ran until #1646 (#1648).
# `tests/tools/` holds the oracle pin, the clock-state assertions, the
# online-gate client and summary, and the serve-low request-set completeness.
#
# #1646 said no lane ran them at all. That was WRONG and #1648 corrects it:
# `tests/CMakeLists.txt` has registered them as the CTest target
# `test_serve_low_tools` since `e58858a91`, and CI's `build-test-cpu` runs
# `ctest --test-dir build` on every pull request. The claim came from grepping
# for `tests.tools`, the dotted module path, while CMake spells it
# `tests/tools` -- a null grep proving the terms wrong rather than the thing
# absent. The parity ledger's "all tools" citations were therefore citing a
# LIVE suite, not a dead one.
#
# The narrow gap was real and this line closes it: preflight ran none of them,
# so a local pre-edit check missed a red these suites would have caught, and
# only a full C++ configure-and-build surfaced it.
#
# DISCOVERED rather than enumerated. An enumeration is a shared list every new
# suite must edit, which is the record-lock shape AGENTS.md §Records forbids;
# discovery makes the file's existence the registration. Standard library only,
# no GPU and no wheel.

#
# This block used to name five: check-agent-record, check-commit-style,
# check-commit-trailers, check-issue-index-append-only and check-now-current.
# scripts/ holds many more than five. "All gates green." therefore described a
# small minority of the gates, and every checker the list omitted reached the
# working tree only where its own test suite happened to call it against the real
# ROOT -- a property of the test, not of the gate (#467).
#
# How many is deliberately not written here. A count of one file stored inside
# another goes stale on an edit whose author never reads this line, and it
# couples every unrelated change to a line it does not own, which AGENTS.md
# §Records forbids. This comment carried `There are 42.` and it was wrong twice
# over: `7dc2ef1ea` took the directory to 41, and later checkers have since put
# it back at 42, so the stale line happened to read true again for a reason
# nobody intended.
#
# `check-issue-index-append-only` above is history, not a file. `7dc2ef1ea`
# deleted it together with the append-only issue index it gated. The loop below
# discovers whatever scripts/check-*.py holds today, which is the point, and a
# named list is the same record-lock shape: every new checker would have to edit
# one shared line here.
#
# A checker that needs arguments this block cannot supply is a SKIP carrying the
# reason, never silence. The argparse USAGE TEXT is what distinguishes that case,
# not the exit code: rc 2 is argparse's usage error AND a legitimate verdict in
# at least one checker here, so keying on the code alone would read a real red as
# "needs arguments" and drop it from the report.

# DOES THE TREE COMPILE? Nothing above this line asks (#2401).
#
# Every gate above validates a record, a document, an anchor or a trailer
# against a tree, and every one of them passes on a tree that does not build.
# `main` was pushed twice on 2026-08-31 in exactly that state -- `5263ac31f`, a
# shell line continuation inside a `//` comment that `-Wcomment` under this
# tree's `-Werror` rejects, and `08fa2f5aa` (#2395), `MlaSharedSelection*` bound
# to a `vt::Tensor*` parameter -- with this script green both times. CI compiles
# four ways and would have caught both, up to two hours after the push, and both
# landed by a direct push. So the missing verdict is not "does anything build",
# it is "does anything build BEFORE the push".
#
# It is diff-scoped, and the scope is the only reason this is affordable: over
# the 60 commits ending at 9fa3be388, 30 touch no C++ at all and cost nothing
# here, 20 reach 1-4 translation units, and the worst reaches 783. A full build
# is ~12 minutes and 9.4 GiB, which is a gate that fires on ordinary work.
#
# THREE states, and the third is not a pass. The checker exits 2 when it could
# not take the measurement -- no cmake, a failed configure, a base that does not
# resolve -- and that maps onto SKIP, which forfeits the banner below and exits
# 1 under --fail-on-skip. It is NOT mapped onto FAIL, because a box without a
# compiler is not a defective change; and it is NOT mapped onto ok, because
# nothing was verified.
#
# BASE_SHA is passed when it resolved, and the REF when it did not, so the
# checker reports the unresolvable base in its own words rather than being
# handed an empty string that would read as an empty diff.
#
# The notice prints BEFORE the run, and it is not decoration. Every other gate
# here finishes in under a few seconds, so `run()` captures output and shows
# only a label. This one can take minutes on a wide header change, and a silent
# multi-minute gate in a list of one-second gates reads as a hang.
