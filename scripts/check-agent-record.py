def strip_code_spans(text: str) -> str:
    """Blank out fenced blocks and inline code, preserving line and column count.

    A target inside a code span is NOT a link: CommonMark renders it as literal
    text, so no reader can follow it and there is nothing for "every link
    resolves" to be about. Before 2026-08-12 this checker validated them anyway
    (#460), which meant no document in the tree could SHOW a link in sample
    output, and, worse, that a docs/BENCHMARKS.md row quoting its evidence link
    could not be archived into .agents/ byte-for-byte.

    THE PAIRING RULE IS COMMONMARK'S, not "the next line that looks like a
    fence". A closing fence must use the OPENER'S character, be at least as
    long, and carry nothing but whitespace after the marker; a line with an info
    string opens a block and never closes one. Getting that wrong does not fail
    safe, it INVERTS fence phase for the rest of the file: with the one
    unbalanced fence this tree already has, a bare ``` at
    .agents/completed/state-events/0000-00/STATE-LEGACY-000001.md:17697 was
    "closed" by the ```sh at :17948, and ordinary prose at :18297 was blanked,
    so a live reader-followable link stopped being validated. Measured
    tree-wide, the loose rule dropped 5 targets and the CommonMark rule drops 4.

# --- record-anchor ratchet (ENG-RECORD-ANCHOR-RATCHET, #632) ------------------
#
# Records cite code as `server_main.cpp:505`. Code moves; the citation does not.
# The checker above LOOKS like it catches that and does not:
#
#   1. NO REPORT, not "no parser". `local_line_anchors` reads BOTH citation
#      forms: the markdown link through `LINK_RE`, and the bare
#      `file.cpp:123` form through `RAW_LOCAL_ANCHOR_RE` since ee511ca8a. It
#      range-checks each one. What it does not do is REPORT: on a missing file
#      and on an out-of-range line the loop runs `continue`, so the bad anchor
#      never enters the returned list, and `is_code_anchor`'s `any()` swallows
#      what is left. There was no symbol test either, which is the gap that
#      matters: 32 of the 38 offenders recorded here are IN RANGE, so a range
#      check could not have found them.
#   2. `any`, NOT `all`. `is_code_anchor` returns true if ONE anchor in a cell
#      qualifies, so a single good link covers arbitrarily many rotted citations
#      beside it. That is not a bug in the STATE gate -- a row IS evidenced by
#      one good anchor, and the `any` stays -- but it is why nothing counted the
#      others.
#   3. STATE. `EVIDENCED_STATES` omits `ACTIVE` and `READY`, so 92 live rows got
#      no anchor check at all.
#
# TWO POPULATIONS, TWO RATIOS, and quoting one without its denominator is what
# produced the false "the bare form was never parsed" claim this comment
# replaces. Measured at `8daa67b39`, the head before this branch merged `main` a
# second time, counting a citation only where it is the WHOLE of a backtick
# span, which is what the parser requires:
#
#   * ALL citation forms in the five matrices, ours and upstream: 492 links and
#     1708 bare, 2200 in total. 525 of the bare forms sit under a
#     `RAW_LOCAL_ANCHOR_RE` prefix, so 1017 of 2200 (46.2%) were already parsed.
#     Most of the remainder are upstream paths that reach no local checker.
#   * The citations this ratchet CLASSIFIES, which is the population that
#     matters: 867. Of those 832 (96.0%) were already parsed AND range-checked
#     before this row, and 35 (4.0%) are genuinely new to parsing, under
#     `.agents/`, `docs/` and `website/`. Every offender recorded then sat in
#     the 96%. The value this row adds is the symbol test and the report, not the
#     parser.
#
# A range check is not the fix: every stale anchor found
# by hand during the 2026-08-13/14 campaign was IN RANGE --
# `docs/USAGE.md:902` (the count line had moved to :1126), `multimodal.py:17-43`
# (the block ends at :45) and `server_main.cpp:308` (a different table entry
# after a 4-line comment landed above). Only "does this line contain the symbol
# named beside it" separates those from a live citation.
#
# THE RATCHET. Enforcing correctness over the whole backlog in one landing would
# surface an unknown amount of unrelated rot, so this mirrors the DSR ratchet in
# scripts/check-device-leakage.py, which this repo already trusts:
# scripts/record-anchor-baseline.json holds the accepted STALE + BROKEN counts,
# a bucket ABOVE its baseline fails, and a bucket BELOW it fails too, with the
# instruction to lower the baseline in the SAME commit as the repair. The number
# only ever moves down, and only deliberately. `--report` names every offender
# so the backlog is legible rather than a number.
#
# WHERE THE CONSERVATIVE LINE IS DRAWN, and why each side of it is where it is.
# A checker that cries wolf gets disabled, and this one has to survive a
# four-figure backlog, so every rule below prefers a missed rot to a false one:
#
#   * ONLY the `code` and `tests` cells of rows in RECORD_ANCHOR_STATES. The
#     `upstream` column is never read. That is what keeps the upstream
#     references (`vllm/model_executor/...py:123`, `csrc/...cu:44`) out of the
#     count structurally, rather than by a path heuristic.
#   * A bare citation must be the WHOLE of a backtick span, so running prose can
#     never be parsed as a path.
#   * It must resolve to a file in the tree, or be a near miss: at least two path
#     separators AND an existing parent directory, i.e. "a directory we own with
#     a filename we do not" -- a rename or a deletion. `vllm/utils/hashing.py`
#     and `tests/v1/core/test_scheduler.py` have no such parent here and are
#     silently skipped, which is correct: they are upstream, and we cannot
#     validate an anchor into a tree we do not have.
#   * A symbol is inferred ONLY from an immediately adjacent backtick span --
#     whitespace between them, or whitespace and one `(` for the trailing
#     `path:line (`Symbol`)` form. Nothing else, and never from prose.
#   * That span must LOOK like a symbol: an identifier, at least 4 characters,
#     carrying `_`, `::`, `()` or an uppercase letter. `bf16` and `nvfp4` sit
#     next to citations constantly and are not symbols; `MoeAuxStream`,
#     `evict_blocks` and `Scheduler::shutdown()` are.
#   * With no inferable symbol the citation is OK by construction. 801 of the
#     867 in-scope citations land there, which is 92.4%, or about 13 in 14.
#     That is the intended polarity: this gate exists to be believed when it
#     does fire.
#   * The symbol test asks whether the cited LINES CONTAIN the name. A comment
#     that mentions the symbol therefore reads OK. That is a measured limit and
#     not a defect: `KERNEL-ATTN-MLA-SPARSE` cites
#     `include/vllm/v1/attention/backend.h:271` for `get_kv_cache_shape`, whose
#     real declaration is at :341, and drift on `main` moved a ROCm comment
#     naming the symbol onto :271. Tightening this would need a parser per
#     language, which is the cry-wolf trade this whole block refuses.
