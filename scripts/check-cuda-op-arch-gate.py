"""Fail if a CUDA op that must exist on EVERY CUDA arch is registered from a
feature-gated translation unit.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT ALREADY HAPPENED (issue #960, and #844 is the
same defect seen from the fallback's end).

`vt::QuantFp8Static`'s CUDA kernel is `out[i] = e4m3(x[i] * (1/scale))` — a plain
elementwise convert with no cutlass dependency of any kind. It lived in
`src/vt/cuda/cuda_matmul_fp8_cutlass.cu`, whose ONLY build gate is
`VT_CUTLASS_FP8_ARCHS`: CMake adds that TU to `_FP8_CUTLASS_SOURCES`, and hence
to the `vllm` target, only when the requested arch list intersects the
cutlass-fp8 feature cell. On sm_110 (Thor) that intersection is EMPTY, which is
the documented normal profile for the arch and not a misconfiguration. So the
kernel was simply not compiled, `OpId::kQuantFp8Static` was never registered for
`DeviceType::kCUDA`, and a CUDA queue asking for it resolved to the portable CPU
reference tier — which dereferenced device pointers and killed the process.

NOTHING REFUSED FIRST, which is what made it expensive. The op's GEMM partner
`kMatmulFp8CublasLt` is registered unconditionally in `cuda_matmul.cu`, so the
model-layer predicate that keys on it passed, the build looked complete, and the
crash arrived one call later inside a "correct but slow" fallback banner.

WHY A STRUCTURAL CHECK AND NOT ONLY A TEST. `tests/vt/test_ops_fp8_cpu.cpp` G4
asserts the registration at run time and is the stronger statement — it observes
the property that actually matters rather than a proxy for it. But it can only
speak on a host that BUILT the CUDA backend without cutlass-fp8, and no CI job
does: the GB10 gate host resolves `cutlass-fp8: ENABLED`, where the defect is
unreachable by construction, and every other job is CPU-only. This file runs in
the ordinary checker lane on every host, reads the build description rather than
a binary, and therefore fails at PR time on the machine of whoever moved the
registration back. Neither instrument subsumes the other; the runtime test is the
claim, this is the tripwire.

WHAT IS ASSERTED, per entry in `REQUIRED`, with no inference about what a kernel
"needs":

  (a) HOME       — the named source file is listed in the UNCONDITIONAL CUDA
                   source list: the `target_sources(vllm PRIVATE ...)` whose
                   enclosing `if()` stack is exactly `[VLLM_CPP_CUDA]`. A file
                   moved under any further condition (`if(VLLM_CPP_CUTLASS)`,
                   `if(VT_CUTLASS_FP8_ARCHS)`, an `else()` branch, a `foreach`)
                   is NOT in that list and fails here.
  (b) REGISTERED — that file contains exactly ONE
                   `RegisterOp(OpId::<name>, DeviceType::kCUDA, ...)`.
  (c) UNGUARDED  — that registration sits at preprocessor-conditional depth 0 in
                   the file, so wrapping it in `#ifdef VT_CUTLASS_FP8` — which
                   would restore the exact original behaviour while leaving the
                   TU in the unconditional list — is not a pass.
  (d) EXCLUSIVE  — no OTHER CUDA source registers the same OpId for kCUDA. A
                   second, gated registration would let a runtime test pass on a
                   cutlass host for the wrong reason and would make (a)-(c)
                   describe a copy that is not the one being selected.

TEXT THE COMPILER NEVER SEES IS NOT A PASS. The C++ side runs through
`checker_text.normalize_source`, so a commented-out or `#if 0`-ed registration
reads as absent, which is what it is. CMake `#` comments are stripped the same
way before the source list is parsed.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated plainly. It does not decide which ops BELONG in the
required set — that is a judgement recorded in `REQUIRED` with its issue, one
line per op, and adding a feature-gated op to it would be wrong. It does not
check that the kernel is correct, that the arch can run it, or that any other op
is registered anywhere. And it reads CMake lexically: a source list assembled
through a variable or a `foreach` is invisible to it and would be reported as a
MISSING home rather than silently accepted.
