"""Classify each gated row's Gates section: does it name a command that can FAIL?

A row's `Gates` field promises "exact commands", and nothing has ever checked
that one exists or that it can fail. A gate that is `true`, `echo ok`, or piped
into another command collapses "done" into the implementer's opinion of its own
work.

This ships as a CLASSIFIER first and a ratchet second, deliberately: most gated
rows cannot state a runnable command today, so a gate demanding one would be red
on arrival and would have to be relaxed to pass. A relaxed gate is worse than no
gate.

The ratchet is the second half, wired only AFTER the debt was recorded
(.agents/specs/gate-command-audit-2026-08-06.md), so it ships green and never had
to be relaxed to pass. It pins the SET of rows carrying a runnable command, and
it is an EXACT PIN, not a shrink-only floor: `--check` below refuses a row that
LOST its command, and tests/scripts/test_check_gate_commands.py additionally
asserts RUNNABLE_BASELINE equals the shipped set, so growth is red too. That is
deliberate -- an exact pin is what makes "just lower the number" impossible --
and it means ANY movement, up or down, re-pins RUNNABLE_BASELINE in the SAME
change, naming the rows and the reason. Growth is welcome; silent growth is not.

# An EXACT PIN over a SET of row IDs -- not a count, and NOT shrink-only.

# Not a count, because a count cannot tell "this row lost its gate command" from
# "this row left the population", and the population moves: 3 rows moved
# mid-branch while the classifier above was being written, which is why the total
# (97) was deliberately never pinned. Pinning a count would go red on a legitimate
# record edit, and the natural "fix" is to lower the number, which is the gate
# erasing its own finding.
#
# Not shrink-only, because the pin is enforced from BOTH sides: `ratchet_errors`
# below catches a row that lost its command, and
# tests/scripts/test_check_gate_commands.py asserts this frozenset EQUALS the
# shipped runnable set, which is what makes lowering the baseline impossible to
# do quietly. The same equality means GROWTH is red too: add a real gate command
# to a row's spec and `--check` stays 0 while the suite, preflight and CI go red
# until this set is re-pinned. That is the intended cost. Growth is ordinary,
# welcome work -- transcribe a row's existing evidence into an invocation -- but
# ANY movement, up or down, re-pins RUNNABLE_BASELINE in the SAME change, naming
# the rows that moved and why.
#
# This is a pin, not a certificate: five of these credits are weak (two MLX
# `pip install` lines, `git diff --check`, TOOLS-STREAMING-PARSER resting solely
# on `git diff --stat`, which exits 0 unconditionally in a repo, and
# KERNEL-GEMM-CPU-ELEM credited a bare `ctest -j2` lifted from prose describing a
# FLAKE). They are pinned anyway -- see
# .agents/specs/gate-command-audit-2026-08-06.md risk 3. A ratchet that waits for
# a clean baseline never starts.
# 2026-08-10: +ENG-RELEASE-CONTAINERS enters the runnable population when its
# spike spec lands (issue #170). The credit is INHERITED, not container-specific,
# and the distinction matters: the row's own gates -- the image layout audit, the
# container smoke, `scripts/check-container-workflow.py` -- do not exist yet, and
# nothing about a container is executed by anything in the tree today. What the
# spec does bind is that every image build runs the release chain it already
# depends on (`scripts/build-*-release.sh`, which end in
# `scripts/validate-release-archive.py`), plus the staged-tree contract in
# `tests/scripts/test_server_package.py`. Those exist and genuinely fail on a
# broken staged tree, so the row is credited rather than pinned as
# gates-no-command -- but this is the weakest kind of credit in the set and it
# is re-earned, not re-confirmed, when W3 lands the container-specific gates.
# 2026-08-09: +ENG-DOCS-SITE enters the runnable population. Its spec's Gates
# section carries `python3 scripts/check-site.py` and `hugo --minify`, both of
# which genuinely fail on a broken site, so it is credited on arrival rather
# than pinned as gates-no-command. Issue #224.

# 2026-08-09: +SAMPLE-PROMPT-LOGPROBS. The row reached ACTIVE with the runner
# prompt-logits source (#223) and its spec's Gates section carries the exact
# configure/build/focused-test/full-ctest invocation the gate was run with,
# including the serial re-run for the known parallel-ctest flake. Growth, so the
# set is re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-10: +LORA-RUNTIME enters the runnable population. It did not gain a
# gate; it re-entered the AUDITED population when the row went back to `ACTIVE`
# for W2 (issue #278) after the 2026-08-04 triage parked it at ANCHOR-BACKFILL.
# Its only pre-existing credit was the UPSTREAM path
# `tests/lora/test_qwen35_densemodel_lora.py` named in prose as the eventual
# model gate -- one of the weak credits described above. The same change adds
# the row's REAL invocation (the CPU configure/build plus
# `ctest -R test_punica_cpu` and `ctest -R test_lora_layers`), so the pin rests
# on a command that genuinely fails when the row regresses.
#
# 2026-08-11: +ENG-RECORD-CONFLICT-SURFACES. The row reaches READY on its
# committed spec (issue #364), whose Gates section names the exact preflight,
# `tests/scripts/` and `agent-integration.py` invocations the record gate runs
# with, and records that no CUDA/GPU/SACRED gate is implicated because no product
# source is touched. Growth, so the set is re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-11: -ENG-ASYNC-SCHED, -SERVE-HTTP-TRANSPORT and
# -ENG-NOW-DERIVED. DONE is closed evidence, not live gated work; #374 exposed
# that retaining DONE made a completed protocol row a permanent runnable
# baseline member. All three departures are the same lifecycle-policy closure,
# not downgraded verdicts or hidden work. Re-adding DONE to GATED_STATES is the
# load-bearing mutation pinned in the paired suite.
# 2026-08-11: +ENG-TRAILER-MERGE-ARTIFACTS on arrival at ACTIVE, then REMOVED
# the same day on reaching DONE (closing commit 157080c8) -- a DONE row leaves
# the gated population, so its verdict is None rather than a downgraded one.
# A shrink for a real record edit, named as the message demands.
# 2026-08-11: +ENG-FORGE-COAUTHOR. Reaches ACTIVE on its committed spec (issue
# #418), whose Gates section names the preflight, tests/scripts and
# agent-integration invocations plus the per-commit re-verification of
# f64f2b71, and records that no CUDA/GPU/SACRED gate is implicated because no
# product source is touched. Growth, so the set is re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-13: +SERVE-RECIPE-ARGS. The row leaves SPIKE for ACTIVE on its
# implementation (issue #606), which puts it in GATED_STATES for the first time;
# its spec's Gates section names `scripts/agent-preflight.sh --staged` plus the

# 2026-08-14: +ENG-RECORD-ANCHOR-RATCHET. The row leaves SPIKE for ACTIVE on its
# implementation (issue #632), which puts it in GATED_STATES for the first time.
# Its spec's Gates section names five invocations, and this is a STRONG credit
# rather than one of the weak ones described above: the row's gate IS
# `scripts/check-agent-record.py`, so the credited command is the thing under
# test, and it fails on either direction of the ratchet. The suite
# (`tests/scripts/test_agent_record.py`) is proven red against the BASE checker
# by `scripts/check-pr-size.py`, which is itself one of the five. Growth from a
# lifecycle move, so the set is re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-16: +SPEC-MTP-K-GT-1. A NEW row arriving at ACTIVE (issue #81), so it
# enters GATED_STATES for the first time. Its spec's Gates section names
# `scripts/agent-preflight.sh` plus the built CPU suite (493 passed / 0 failed /
# 2 skipped of 495, the two skips checkpoint-gated and unrelated) and the three
# focused doctest binaries, and records what is NOT implicated and why: the
# change reaches a GPU forward only through paths the CPU tier already runs, so
# no CUDA or SACRED gate is claimed here, and the DGX three-way at k=2..4 is
# recorded as OWED rather than skipped. Growth, so the set is re-pinned in the
# same change.
# 2026-08-17: +ENG-RESIDENCY-CONFIG. A NEW row arriving at ACTIVE (issue #1110),
# so it enters GATED_STATES for the first time. Its spec's Gates section names the
# documented CPU configure/build recipe, `ctest -j 6`, the three focused doctest
# binaries by name, `scripts/agent-preflight.sh --staged`, and the reachability
# mutation (delete the install call site in `LoadedEngine::FromModelDir`, require
# the server-level suite red). It also records what is NOT implicated and why: the
# row moves where a value comes from and changes no kernel, dtype, allocation or
# token, so it claims no CUDA, SACRED or throughput gate, and the 370 GiB
# reproduction through the JSON form is recorded as OWED rather than skipped
# because dgx.casa was unreachable at the SSH layer. Growth, so the set is
# re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-18: +ENG-CUDAGRAPH-DEDUP. A NEW row arriving at ACTIVE (issue #1162),
# so it enters GATED_STATES for the first time. Its spec's Gates section names
# `ctest -R test_graph_dedup` and `scripts/agent-preflight.sh`, both of which
# genuinely fail when the row regresses -- the focused suite detected 9 of 9
# negative mutations of the registry it gates. It also records what is NOT
# claimed and why: the device byte-identity A/B needs a leased CUDA box this
# session did not have, so it is carried under the spec's `## Owed` rather than
# reported as run, and the CUDA leg's compile rests on the `cuda-fat-build` CI
# job. Growth, so the set is re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-18: +ENG-HF-MODEL-DOWNLOAD. A NEW row arriving at READY (issue #1280),
# so it enters GATED_STATES for the first time. Its spec's Gates section names
# `scripts/validate-container-image.py`, which boots the image and asserts the
# failure for an unknown repository is an HTTP 404 from the hub rather than the
# message that names the build options. That distinction is the point: a symbol
# check passes on a build where `VLLM_CPP_HF_DOWNLOAD` resolved OFF, so the
# container gate is the only instrument that separates a working TLS build from
# a silently disabled one. The section also records what the runnable gates do
# NOT cover: the hermetic suite speaks plain hypertext transfer protocol, so it
# proves nothing about transport layer security, and the second instrument is an
# opt-in online test that does not run in the default lane. Growth, so the set
# is re-pinned in the same change.
# 2026-08-19: +ENG-CUDAGRAPH-BREAK, and this entry is a REPAIR rather than a
# landing. W5 of that row (#1361, commit 601b576c6) filled its spec's Gates
# section with runnable evidence, including a named test binary with its case
# and assertion counts and an exit status, which is what moves a row into the
# runnable population. The re-pin this ratchet's own error text demands was not
# made in that change, so `main` itself has been red on
# tests/scripts/test_check_gate_commands.py since it landed: 8 failures of 44,
# every one a comparison between the computed runnable set and this pin,
# measured in a detached worktree of origin/main. The continuous integration
# lane that would have caught it independently has not executed for this
# repository since roughly 07:43Z that day, so the change landed with no remote
# verdict. Found while merging origin/main into row/ENG-HF-MODEL-DOWNLOAD and
# fixed in that flow under #1376, because the fix is small and clear and a red
# main blocks every other row's gate. Growth, so the set is re-pinned.
