"""GATE-ORACLE-PINS (#647) — every oracle is named, pinned, and honest about it.

`AGENTS.md` §"When vLLM has no implementation" admits a secondary oracle only
where vLLM implements nothing, only from a fixed set, and only at a recorded
pin. This checker is what stops that rule decaying into prose:

  * every `.agents/oracles/<id>.md` carries exactly one ```oracle-pin block with
    every required key present and non-empty, and no key nobody defined;
  * exactly one record is `role = primary`, and it is `vllm`;
  * the AGENTS.md admissible-oracle table and the directory name the SAME ids,
    in both directions — so an oracle cannot be admitted in prose without a pin
    file, nor pinned in a file nobody is allowed to use;
  * `gateable = yes` requires a revision that is not `UNPINNED` AND evidence
    that is a path EXISTING IN THIS TREE. An issue number is a promise of a
    measurement, so it is refused here and required in the other direction:
    `gateable = no` must name the issue that owes it, which is what keeps an
    ungateable lane visible debt instead of a mid-campaign discovery;
  * the `vllm` record's `pin` and `pin_label` AGREE with the ```parity-pin
    block in `.agents/upstream-sync.md`, which is the authority (#2829).
  * every `pin:commit` / `pin:label` span in the PROSE surfaces named by
    `PIN_SURFACES` agrees with that same authority, and each of those paths
    carries at least one `commit` span (#2883);
  * no marker in those surfaces STARTS ITS LINE, because at column 1 an HTML
    comment is a CommonMark block that interrupts the paragraph and stops the
    span's value rendering as Markdown. See `PIN_AT_LINE_START`.

THE PARITY RECONCILIATION, because it reverses what this docstring used to say.

Until #2829 this file argued that comparing the two surfaces would "BLESS the
duplication, not remove it", and declined to. That reasoning is right about the
FIX and it left the hole open in the meantime: with `upstream-sync.md` advanced
and `oracles/vllm.md` rolled back to the prior revision, this checker,
`tests/tools/test_oracle_pin` and `check-agent-record.py` were all measured
GREEN over a tree whose two pin surfaces named different vLLM commits. A pin
advance is exactly the edit that leaves one surface behind, and the value had
not moved since 2026-07-26, so the drift had never had an opportunity to appear.

So the rule below is the INTERIM, and it says which file is authoritative rather
than syncing two equals. The expectation is read from `upstream-sync.md`; the
value under test is read from `oracles/vllm.md`; an anchor checker that read its
expectation out of the file it checks would be a tautology. Removing the copy
altogether is still the better fix and is still available on top of this: see
`.agents/specs/oracle-pin-parity-reconcile.md` for why it needs a per-id
exemption from `REQUIRED_KEYS` that this change did not take.

It is scoped to `vllm.md` BY FILENAME STEM. Every other oracle holds its pin
only in its own file and has no `parity-pin` counterpart, so a registry-wide
version of this rule would fail all thirteen of them for being correct.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, so nobody cites it for more than it delivers:

  * It does not verify that a pin EXISTS upstream. It is deliberately
    network-free — a gate that fails when GitHub is unreachable fails on the
    wrong thing. A fabricated 40-hex string passes shape and fails review.
  * It does not REMOVE the duplication it now reconciles. `oracles/vllm.md`
    still stores a literal, and a checked copy is weaker than no copy.
  * The `**Secondary oracle:**` declaration check is OPT-IN by syntax. A spec
    that merely mentions llama.cpp in prose is not scanned, because a checker
    that fired on the word "SGLang" would go red on hundreds of files that are
    doing nothing wrong and would be silenced within a week.

THE PROSE SURFACES, and why they are delimited rather than parsed (#2883).

`.agents/NOW.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `docs/benchmarks/how-we-measure.md`,
`docs/benchmarks/speculative-decoding.md` and
`docs/benchmarks/vllm-online-serving.md` restate the abbreviated revision and
the release label in sentences. #2880
declined to gate them and its argument was narrower than it read: a grep for a
prior pin returns files that name it ON PURPOSE, which rules out a REGEX OVER
PROSE and does not rule out a rule over NAMED PATHS. #2880 measured 286 such
files; the figure was restated here and in two specs as if measured again, and
it is not the number this tree carries -- `git grep -l 555967922` returns 846
at `aa7056b46`. Either count rules out the regex, which is why the conclusion
stands and the figure did not.

A token rule over unmarked prose was built far enough to reject it, and it fails
on real content in both directions. `docs/FEATURES.md` names the llama.cpp pin
`b10451` one line below the vLLM pin, six characters drawn entirely from
[0-9a-f], so a "backticked hex word" heuristic reads a second project's pin as a
malformed vLLM revision; and a containment rule asking whether the public
version appears in the sentence passes a surface reading `0.28.1rc1.dev1320`.

So the surfaces are DELIMITED instead. An inline `<!--pin:commit-->` /
`<!--pin:label-->` span makes the span content the value: no token regex, no
sentence shape, no positional assumption, and nothing outside a span is read, so
the rule cannot fire when somebody rewraps a paragraph. A marker renders as
nothing ONLY WHERE IT IS INLINE, so `PIN_AT_LINE_START` is a rule and not a
convention: the first version of this change asserted the invisibility in three
documents, measured it in none, and broke a paragraph of `docs/FEATURES.md` on
GitHub's own renderer. The markers' ABSENCE from a named path is an error, which
is what stops the rule being silenced by deleting them.

Run with `--self-test` to sweep the FIXTURES corpus below in both directions:
every `bad=True` fixture must be reported and every `bad=False` one must not.

# and the reader sees literal backticks where a `<code>` was.
#
# MEASURED ON GITHUB'S OWN RENDERER (`gh api /markdown`), one probe per shape,
# because the previous version of this change reasoned about this and was wrong:
#
#   indent 0-3, mid-paragraph or after a blank line -> HTML block, paragraph
#     splits, the value renders as literal backticks;
#   indent >= 4 after a blank line -> INDENTED CODE BLOCK, and the marker

# one shape that would have rendered correctly: a marker behind four spaces of
# a paragraph CONTINUATION line. Nobody writes that, and it is one blank line
# away from the worst of the three outcomes. The conservative boundary is
# deliberate and is the cost of a rule with no renderer in it.
#
# The defect this catches is not hypothetical. `docs/FEATURES.md:46` shipped a
# column-1 opener inside the *Results.* paragraph: `gh api /markdown` on the
# whole file returned 21 `<p>` for a document with 20 paragraphs and printed
# ``e126687a9a`` with its backticks, and the repaired file returns 20 `<p>` and
# a second `<code>e126687a9a</code>`. No renderer is imported here -- this
# checker is deliberately dependency-free and network-free, and a gate that
# fails when GitHub is unreachable fails on the wrong thing -- so the rule is
# the POSITION that produces the break, which is exactly checkable from bytes.

# #2883 asks a rule to settle the abbreviation length, and observes that

# `.agents/oracles/vllm.md`. A fixed length would invent a convention and go red
# on the shape the repository already uses, and AGENTS.md is explicit that a
# gate which fires on ordinary work is the defect.
#
# Correctness is therefore "is a prefix of vllm_commit". The floor exists for
# ONE reason: below eight hex characters an abbreviation can collide with a
# DIFFERENT commit by accident, and the rule would then pass a stale surface.
# Eight is 4.3e9 values and is the shortest abbreviation this tree writes, so
# the floor rejects `e1` without rejecting anything anybody does today.
