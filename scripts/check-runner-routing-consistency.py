"""Fail if a registered model's decode goes off the production runner/decode seam.

The THIRD "MUST route through, not re-implement" seam (alongside the glue
`vt::FusedChain` catalog and the merged-GEMM `MlpGateUpMethodBase` family, both
policed by scripts/check-fusion-consistency.py): the **decode/runtime path**. A new
model's decode MUST enter the production runner (`ModelRegistry::Forward`, the
registry factory `.forward` hook) and return device-resident logits
(`ForwardLogits.on_device()==true`) on the default `gather_logits` path — handed
straight to the on-GPU sampler — NOT a private generate/argmax loop with a host
logit download. A model born off the runner inherits none of the parity-enablers
(paged bf16-KV attention, on-GPU sampling, shared MoE builders, device RoPE,
decode-graph capture) and forces per-model rediscovery — the "Laguna anti-pattern"
(AGENTS.md, the decode/runtime seam added in `c5c872e6`).

Three invariants, checked per `REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL` (`.forward = &Fn`):

(a) **ON-DEVICE LOGITS** — the model's DEFAULT (`gather_logits`) production forward
    returns a device-resident `ForwardLogits` (reaches the device-logits seam
    `WrapDeviceLogits` / `ViewDeviceLogits` / a `device_storage`/`device_tensor`
    assignment). A registered model whose production forward instead returns
    `HostLogits` / a host `logits.Download` off the on-GPU sampler is DRIFT.

(b) **RUNNER-ROUTED (no private host generate loop)** — the same model must not
    ALSO ship a private `*GenerateCore` host greedy-argmax decode loop as its real
    decode path (the Qwen3-VL escape: `VLGenerateCore` + host `ArgMax`). This is an
    ENRICHMENT of (a): it is only reported for a model already classified HOST, so a
    CLEAN device-resident model that merely keeps a `*GenerateCore` example helper
    around (e.g. qwen3_5's `VLGenerateCoreGdn`) is NOT flagged — the runner path,
    not the presence of a helper, is what makes a model "born on the runner".

(c) **BF16-RESIDENT ACTIVATIONS** — the model's decode path must keep the residual/
    activation stream in bf16 **device** buffers (the shared `dense_attn::AttnBlock`
    preamble + `DBuf` glue, mirroring vLLM's per-op bf16 stores), NOT hand-roll a
    private `std::vector<float>` host residual stream threaded through the per-token
    decode with a `CastBf16`/`GemmBf16`-before-every-projection anti-pattern (AGENTS.md
    born-on-the-runner: "`DBuf`s, not an f32 host residual stream with a `CastBf16`
    before every projection"). A model whose decode files declare >= MIN_F32_RESID
    private f32 residual-stream buffers (`std::vector<float> {hidden,residual,resid,
    hn,hs,x,...}`) AND route the stream through NEITHER the shared bf16 attn preamble
    (`dense_attn::AttnBlock(`) NOR a bf16-`DBuf` residual (`DBuf hidden/res ... kBF16`)
    is classified **F32_STREAM** (drift); an on-framework `DBuf`-based decode is
    **BF16_RESIDENT** (clean). This axis is ORTHOGONAL to (a): deepseek_v4 returns
    device-resident logits (DEVICE, clean on (a)) yet computes its whole decode in an
    f32 host vector stream and only uploads the final logits (F32_STREAM, drift on (c));
    qwen3_vl is HOST on (a)/(b) yet its per-token transformer decode residual is a bf16
    `DBuf` (BF16_RESIDENT, clean on (c)). Supporting per-projection host casts
    (`CastBf16(`/`GemmBf16(`) are REPORTED but not required: laguna casts hn->bf16 before
    each projection (18 sites) while deepseek_v4 keeps everything f32 and quantizes
    per-GEMM (0 CastBf16) — both are the same f32-host-stream escape, so the load-bearing
    signal is the f32 residual-stream declaration + the ABSENCE of a bf16-resident stream,
    not the cast-kernel name. This invariant is REFUSE-skipped like (a): a
    VT_CHECK(false) stub decodes nothing.

Like check-fusion-consistency.py this is a coarse FLOOR, not a per-site proof, and it
resolves through the codebase's real seams so the false-positive/negative rate stays
low:
  * the registered `.forward` hook usually DELEGATES on its `gather_logits` branch to
    `SomeModel::ForwardDevice(...)`; the classification follows that call into the
    ForwardDevice IMPL body (so laguna/qwen3_vl, whose ForwardDevice is a HOST stub
    returning `HostLogits`/`out.host`, are caught even though their registry hook looks
    identical to a clean model's);
  * and ONE further hop into a file-local `ForwardLogits`-returning helper the impl
    calls, so a model that builds its device carrier in its OWN wrapper rather than
    the shared `WrapDeviceLogits` still reads as DEVICE (deepseek_v4's
    `WrapV4DeviceLogits`). Without the hop such a model matched neither seam and
    classified NONE — not an error state, so it dropped out of the drift check
    entirely and the gate stayed green while silently exempting it;
  * `using LlamaModel = Qwen3DenseModel;` aliases are resolved (llama/mistral/internlm2
    reuse the qwen3 dense device forward);
  * a REFUSE-by-name stub (`KimiK3Model::ForwardDevice` is `VT_CHECK(false)`) decodes
    nothing and is SKIPPED, not flagged;
  * a multimodal model with a device text-decode path plus a host mm-PREFILL path
    (gemma4) is CLEAN — its default decode still reaches ForwardDevice.

A model that legitimately cannot route yet is a CONSCIOUS, reviewable allowlist entry
with a reason + fold-plan tier — never a silent landing. The (a)/(b) logits/generate
seam has its own allowlist (scripts/runner-routing-allowlist.txt: laguna, qwen3_vl);
the (c) bf16-activation seam has a SIBLING allowlist
(scripts/runner-bf16-activation-allowlist.txt: laguna, deepseek_v4) — kept separate
because the two axes have DIFFERENT membership (deepseek_v4 is clean on (a) but drifts
on (c); qwen3_vl drifts on (a)/(b) but is clean on (c)), so a shared flat list would
silently cross-suppress. Removing an (a)/(b) entry after the model returns
device-resident logits, or a (c) entry after its decode routes onto the shared bf16
`AttnBlock`/`DBuf` glue (byte-exact / token-exact-or-near-tie gated), is the enforcement
gate closing.

The validation logic is pure functions (`classify_body`, `classify_activation_stream`,
`drift_models`, `f32_stream_drift_models`) so it is unit- and mutation-testable
(tests/scripts/test_check_runner_routing_consistency.py), mirroring
check-fusion-consistency.py.
