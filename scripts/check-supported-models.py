"""Bind the public supported-architecture list to the C++ model registry.

The "supported models" claim on docs/FEATURES.md must never drift from what the
engine actually registers. The authority on "supported" is the C++ registry:
each architecture self-registers from its own translation unit via
`REGISTER_VLLM_MODEL(symbol, "ArchString", factory, info)`
(src/vllm/model_executor/models/*.cpp). `ModelRegistry::SupportedArchs()`
enumerates exactly those strings, and tests/vllm/test_model_loader_gguf.cpp pins
the same set as the canonical "Supported architectures:" error string, so the
C++ side is already self-consistent. This checker closes the loop to the public
doc: the registered set and the FEATURES list must be equal.

It asserts, over docs/FEATURES.md's marked supported-architecture table:
  1. every registered architecture has a row (no silently-supported arch missing
     from the public list), and
  2. no row claims an architecture the code does not register (no aspirational or
     stale entry on the public list).

The table is delimited by
  <!-- supported-arch-table:begin --> ... <!-- supported-arch-table:end -->
so non-registered lanes (standalone audio/diffusion forwards, speculator draft
heads, and inventoried-but-blocked archs) can be described elsewhere on the page
without tripping the registry-equality check. Only the FIRST column (the
Architecture key) of the rows inside that block is scanned, so an arch name
mentioned in a prose cell never counts as a claim.

The validation logic is the pure function `supported_models_errors(registered,
features_text)` so it is unit- and mutation-testable (see
tests/scripts/test_check_supported_models.py), mirroring
check-benchmark-index.py and check-model-checklist.py. Per AGENTS.md, never
weaken this checker to make the public list pass: fix the list or register the
arch.
