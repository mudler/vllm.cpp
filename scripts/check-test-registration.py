"""Require critical regression tests to remain buildable and CTest-registered.

The CPU CI lane builds every target and runs ``ctest``, but both promises become
vacuous when a regression test is accidentally removed from ``tests/CMakeLists.txt``.
This tree gate pins the small set of tests whose review explicitly requires a
non-vacuous registration guard.  It also verifies that the shared helper still
creates an executable *and* registers that executable with CTest.

It pins CTest LABELS for the same reason, and the reason is measured rather than
assumed.  A gate whose preconditions no runner has is invoked by label -- the
documented recipe is ``ctest -L gpu`` -- and ``ctest -L`` prints
``No tests were found!!!`` and returns **0** when the label selects nothing
(CMake 3.28.3).  So a renamed or deleted label turns a documented gate into a
command that measures nothing while reporting success, which is the exact defect
class the labelled gate itself exists to close.  ``REQUIRED_LABEL_SELECTIONS``
holds the expected selection as a literal in this file, never read back out of
``tests/CMakeLists.txt``, because a checker that reads its expectation from the
file it checks is a tautology.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The registration must agree with the LINK (#1883).
#
# `if(VLLM_CPP_SERVER)` in the top-level CMakeLists decides which translation
# units enter `libvllm`.  A test target registered OUTSIDE that guard is still
# configured when the flag is OFF, and CMake is happy, because nothing about a
# missing definition is visible until `ld` runs.  So the failure lands at link
# time on a configuration CI exercises and no configure-only gate can see.
#
# This check is STATIC and derives BOTH sides.  It reads the gated
# `target_sources` out of the top-level file, resolves each one's declaring
# header, walks the tree's own `#include "..."` graph, and refuses any
# `vllm_cpp_add_test` target outside the guard whose sources reach one of those
# headers.  Nothing here is transcribed from the file it checks: the gated set
# is read, not listed, so adding a seventh gated translation unit extends the
# gate instead of aging it out.
#
# What the proxy CANNOT see, stated because an unwritten limit gets quoted as
# though it were none:
#   * it matches the declaring HEADER, not the symbol, so a hand-declared
#     `extern` or a macro-built call is invisible to it;
#   * it reads `#include "..."` only, and would miss an angle-bracket include of
#     a repository header (the tree uses quotes for its own headers);
#   * it can fire on an include that no longer carries a call.  That is still a
#     defect worth naming -- an unused include of a conditionally compiled
#     header -- and the fix is to drop the include or move the target, never to
#     widen this check;
#   * it says nothing about whether the suite is REACHED.  That is
#     `.agents/reachability.md`'s question, and this gate does not answer it.
