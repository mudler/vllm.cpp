// This is the HOST (CPU) reference forward, the same cadence Kimi-Linear's W2-W6
// took (kimi_linear_forward.cpp:1-26) and DeepSeek-V4's `DeepseekV4ForwardHost`
// before it: a real forward composed out of the ALREADY-LANDED `vt::` ops, run
// on a CPU queue, so the mechanism is gateable before any GPU is involved. What
// it is NOT:
//   * NOT a weight loader. Nothing here reads a checkpoint. The safetensors
//     materialization of the 18487 tensors `EnumerateNemotronHTensors` names —
//     including the NVFP4 W4A16 g16 experts and the FP8 W8A8 mamba projections —
//     is still owed, and `NemotronHForward` REFUSES BY NAME when handed
//     unmaterialized weights rather than returning zeros.
//   * NOT the MTP head (W5), NOT the GGUF arm (W7), NOT a speed claim.
//   * NOT the paged/device runner path (W6). The recurrent state here is FRESH
//     per call and single-sequence; `MakeNemotronHKVCache` already declares the
//     het-KV topology the runner will drive, and wiring it is W6's.

// The DTYPE IS THE POINT, not an implementation detail. vLLM resolves ONE model

// explicitly so a gate can assert the memory format instead of inferring it from
// matching tokens — a dtype that is too WIDE is numerically correct and
// therefore invisible to a token comparison.
// The MEMORY FORMAT a materialized weight is held in. This is the whole point

// MIXED_PRECISION` and is NOT uniform — routed/shared experts and `lm_head` are
// NVFP4 W4A16 group-16, the 46 mamba `in_proj`/`out_proj` are FP8 W8A8 static,

// AGENTS.md forbids a parallel path, and adding a `d_dev` to NemotronHOwned
// would have been exactly one.
//
// NemotronHOwned SURVIVES for the weights whose device arm is not ported yet —
// the 5935 NVFP4 W4A16 g16 projections (routed + shared experts, lm_head) and
// the 46 FP8 W8A8 static mamba projections. It is the right holder for them
// BECAUSE it is not OwnedTensor: OwnedTensor carries no `form`, no group
// `scale`, no `global_scale` and no `input_scale` (qwen3_5_weights.h:47-77), so
// converting a quantized weight to it would DISCARD the memory format the
// checkpoint ships and silently commit this model to a widened one. When those

//           for the whole forward.
//   HOST    the 23 Mamba2 blocks (their in_proj/out_proj are FP8 W8A8 and the
//           shared FP8 linear seam is not extracted yet — issue #940), the 23
//           MoE blocks and lm_head (NVFP4 W4A16 g16, 30.19e9 parameters).
//
// So 46 of 52 layers still compute on the host, and each of them costs one
// download of the normed hidden and one upload of the mixer output. That bounce
// is SCAFFOLD, not architecture: every later unit deletes one pair of it. It is
// also why this arm makes NO speed claim of any kind.
//
// NON-PAGED, SINGLE REQUEST. Nothing here consumes `attn_kv`, `gdn_state`,

// `ForwardNemotronHForCausalLM` (nemotron_h_registry.cpp:161-170) keeps ALL
// THREE of its clauses. A2-R does not create the capability that interlock
// guards, so it does not narrow it.

// input and output so a gate can drive ONE block in isolation.
//

//
// THE DIFFERENCE FROM EVERY FORWARD ABOVE, in one sentence: this one reads and
// writes the RUNNER'S caches instead of rebuilding them. `NemotronHForward` and
// `NemotronHDeviceForward` recompute Q/K/V over the whole sequence on every call
// (nemotron_h.cpp:657-659) and start each call from FRESH recurrent state, so a
// server past decode step 1 would produce fluent WRONG tokens. This forward
// writes each step's K/V into `input.attn_kv` at `input.attn_meta.slot_mapping`
// and reads attention back out of those pages, and it gathers the conv/SSM rows
// out of `input.gdn_state` at the step's state indices and scatters the updated
// rows back. That is what makes a multi-step decode correct, and it is what
// narrows the G-SAFE interlock at `nemotron_h_registry.cpp:161`.
//
// SINGLE REQUEST. `input.num_reqs <= 1` stays refused by that interlock until
// A2-B: nothing here reorders a batch or splits decodes from prefills across
// requests. The per-request INDEXING machinery is nonetheless real — the state
// slot comes from the metadata's state-index vector and the block table, never
// from a hardcoded 0 (spec §4.1) — because a forward that hardcodes slot 0
// passes every gate A2-P owns and then fails silently under A2-B.
//
// WHAT STILL RUNS ON THE HOST, and why it is not this unit's to move:
//   * the 23 Mamba2 blocks. Their `in_proj` is FP8 W8A8 static and the block is
//     not splittable, so the compute stays on `NemotronHMamba2Mixer` (A2-Q1 owns
//     the device arm, issue #940). A2-P carries the STATE — gather from the
//     device page, run the host mixer over it, scatter back — which is exactly
//     what the spec's §1.1 means by "the paged wiring can land against them".
//   * `lm_head`, NVFP4 W4A16 g16, refused on a non-CPU queue at
//     nemotron_h.cpp:1031-1034. A2-Q2b owns it, so this forward still returns
//     HOST logits and `scripts/runner-routing-allowlist.txt` is NARROWED rather
//     than removed (spec §3.5).
//   * a MoE block whose experts are not NVFP4, or a build with no Marlin arm.
//     A2-Q2a's device arm is taken whenever it is available.
//
// Runs on WHATEVER queue the runner hands it. On CUDA that is the device path;
// on a CPU queue every op below is registered too, which is what lets the
// multi-step gate run without a GPU. `positions` is deliberately unread:
// NemotronH has NO positional embedding of any kind
