// Nemotron-H (`NemotronHForCausalLM`) — the WEIGHT LOADER (implemented in
// `nemotron_h_weights.cpp`, beside the enumeration it must agree with)
// ([spec](../../../../.agents/specs/nemotron-h-model.md) §5b, §6b "Still owed
// after W4"; issue #517).
//
// W3 enumerated all 18487 released tensors and W4 made the architecture
// compute. Neither MATERIALIZED anything, so every checkpoint load left
// `NemotronHHostWeights::materialized` false and the forward refused by name.
// This is that brick.
//
// ─── THE CHECKPOINT IS NOT UNIFORM, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE JOB ────────────────
//
// `quant_algo: MIXED_PRECISION`, `quant_method: modelopt`. One file carries
// three memory formats, and the repo name ("...-NVFP4") describes only the
// biggest of them:
//
//   routed experts, shared experts, lm_head   NVFP4 W4A16, group_size=16
//     .weight         U8      [out, in/2]     two E2M1 nibbles per byte
//     .weight_scale   F8_E4M3 [out, in/16]    one linear e4m3 per 16 inputs
//     .weight_scale_2 F32     scalar          the global scale, MULTIPLIED
//
//   mamba in_proj / out_proj (46 targets)     FP8 W8A8 static
//     .weight         F8_E4M3 [out, in]
//     .weight_scale   F32     scalar
//     .input_scale    F32     [1]             the STATIC activation scale
//
//   attention q/k/v/o, conv1d, gates, norms, embeddings   plain bf16 / f32
//   KV cache                                  fp8: k_proj.k_scale, v_proj.v_scale
//
// Reading it as UNIFORM NVFP4 is the failure a token gate cannot see: the
// answer stays numerically plausible, the tokens still match, and the load
// moves the wrong bytes. So every weight is held in the format it SHIPS in, and
// the load report states the composition as hard numbers rather than leaving it
// to be inferred.
//
// ─── WHY THE QUANTIZED FORMS ARE KEPT, NOT DEQUANTIZED AT LOAD ───────────────
//
// Two reasons, and the first one is arithmetic. The 5888 routed-expert
// projections are 29.4e9 parameters: 16.5 GB packed (14.7 GB of nibbles at
// 0.5 B/param plus 1.84 GB of group scales at 1 B per 16 — 15.4 GiB), against
// 58.7 GB at bf16. Both figures are DECIMAL GB, and that unit is the point: the
// same number written GiB is 7% wrong in the direction that flatters us. A
// dequantize-at-load loader does not fit on any box this project owns, and on a
// unified-memory box it takes the machine down rather than failing. The second
// is the rule: a widened weight is numerically correct and invisible to a token
// comparison while moving twice the bytes (AGENTS.md).
//
// The host reference forward has no NVFP4 and no FP8 GEMM — those are the CUDA
// `kMoeGroupedGemmNvfp4Marlin` and fp8-linear arms W6 selects. It therefore
// widens a quantized operand TRANSIENTLY at the GEMM call site, through the
// shared `model_loader/nvfp4_dequant.h` seam, and the report below names and
// counts that arm so it is a declared property of this path rather than
// something a reader has to find.
//
// ─── WHAT IS DEFERRED, BY NAME ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The 270-tensor MTP tower (`mtp.layers.*`, unquantized bf16 because the
// `ignore` list carries `mtp*`) is W5 and is NOT materialized. It is counted and
// named in the report rather than skipped silently: 270 tensors dropped on the
// floor is 270 tensors nobody notices. The GGUF arm (W7) refuses earlier, in
// the registry TU.
