"""`scripts/agent-preflight.sh` never reports green over a block that did not run.

Row `GATE-PREFLIGHT-SKIP-REPORT`, issue #998, spec
`.agents/specs/gate-preflight-skip-report.md`.

The defect this suite pins: the trailer block was guarded by
`git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD`, and when that guard was false
the block emitted NOTHING and the run still printed `All gates green.` and
exited 0. Two gates left the report without a word. It fired three times in one
session, twice because `origin/main` is a remote-tracking ref that every
worktree of one checkout shares, so another worktree's fetch moved it BETWEEN
the top of the run and the guard. On the third the `ok` count fell from 76 to 74
and the banner did not change.

That last number is the whole problem in one line. Nothing in the output
distinguished a run that checked the trailers from a run that did not, so the
only reader who could catch it was one who read the script.

## Why this suite executes the script instead of grepping it

Every assertion here could be spelled as a text match against the script, and
every one of them would then be satisfied by a REWRITE while missing an
OVERRIDE on a later line. `tests/scripts/test_agent_onboard.py` already learned
that lesson about `REQUIRE_ROLE` and switched to executing the script. The same
reasoning applies harder here, because what is under test is control flow across
four `git` calls, not the value of a variable.

## Why it can execute the script without recursing

`scripts/agent-preflight.sh` runs this very suite from its `SUITES` array, so a
nested full run would recurse without bound. `--role-only` exists for that
problem and is too narrow here, because the blocks under test are the last two
in the file.

So the run is pointed at a SCRATCH repository instead: the script is copied into
a temporary git repo and a stub `python3` that exits 0 is put on `PATH`. Every
`run` then reports `ok` without executing a checker, nothing re-enters this
suite, and the git-shaped control flow under test executes for real against refs
the test owns. `ROOT` in the script is derived from `BASH_SOURCE`, so the copy
makes the scratch repo the script's own tree.
