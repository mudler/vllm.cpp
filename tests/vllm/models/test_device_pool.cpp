// vllm.cpp original (the shared scratch pool is a vt-runtime deviation, porting
// inventory §9.1); vLLM has no mirror because it never had this design — its
// allocation handle carries the device as field 0
// (`vllm/device_allocator/__init__.py:12-14` @ pin 555967922) and torch's cache
// is per-device by construction (`c10/cuda/CUDACachingAllocator.h:118-172`).
//
// THE GATE FOR #516 (.agents/specs/pool-device-key.md): `vllm::Pool()` was a
// process-wide free list keyed by BYTE SIZE CLASS ONLY. The device was not in
// the key, so a block allocated through one backend was handed to a `DBuf`
// running on another. One fault, two symptoms, chosen by direction:
//
//   cudaMalloc block -> CPU-backend forward : SIGSEGV, compute-sanitizer CLEAN
//                                             (the fault is host-side)
//   host block       -> CUDA forward        : SILENT all-NaN output
//
// This file is the DIRECT gate. It needs no GPU, no checkpoint and no NAS: two
// distinguishable fake backends stand in for two devices (the technique
// tests/vt/test_backend_multidevice.cpp and tests/vt/test_reference_tier.cpp
// already use), and every case goes through `dense_attn::DBuf` — the seam every
// production forward allocates from — so it holds the same path the LTX-2.5
// device suite crashes on rather than a paraphrase of it.
//
// Two test-side properties are load-bearing and neither is a style choice.
// (1) A fake backend NEVER returns a block to the C allocator: these cases
// compare pointer identity ACROSS a free, and a freed pointer is not a value you
// may reason about. (2) A fake backend is never destroyed before exit, so no
// stack or heap address is ever reused — the pool is keyed on the backend's
// identity, and an address reused by a later case would make one case's pool
// answer another case's question.
//
// THE TWO DEBUG LANES ARE GREEN HERE, ON PURPOSE. `VT_POOL_BYPASS=1` removes the
// free list and `VT_POOL_EXACT=1` removes size-class rounding; the spec's own
// §10 hands `VT_POOL_BYPASS=1` to whoever picks up the unattributed dgx failures
// as "the cheap discriminator that needs no second build". A suite that reds
// under the very lane it tells you to use is a suite that costs its next reader
// an hour deciding whether the red is theirs. So: a case whose subject is REUSE
// states what the ACTIVE lane does — a pooled hit by default, a fresh driver
// block under bypass — and the case whose subject is the SIZE CLASS states
// sharing by default and SEPARATION under `VT_POOL_EXACT` (spec §5 T1.3's
// second clause, which had no assertion until now). Both env vars are read ONCE
// into a function-local static inside `DevicePool`, so a process is in exactly
// one lane for its whole life and no case can toggle them.

// CONCURRENCY. Every case above this line runs on one thread, and until now so
// did every case anywhere that touches `DevicePool` — the pool held a mutex
// that nothing in the tree had ever contended. `sanitize-cpu (thread)` runs
// this suite, so the file was NOMINALLY covered by ThreadSanitizer while giving
// it no concurrent access to observe, which is not coverage.
//
// This matters now rather than in the abstract: `--max-num-seqs > 1` is the
// configuration the #1922 follow-up ladder measures, and the borrow added in
// that row (#1930) put two NEW pieces of shared mutable state behind that mutex
// — the `block_class_` map and the cross-class `retained_` arithmetic — where
// before there was one free list per key and nothing that read another class's.
//
// WHAT THE CASE ASSERTS, and why each assertion can fail on its own:
//
//   no double issue   — two threads must never hold one block at the same time.
//                       A `live` set guarded by ITS OWN mutex catches that
//                       directly, and the byte pattern each thread writes into
//                       its block catches it a second time, as a data race
//                       ThreadSanitizer reports on the block itself rather than
//                       as a count this file has to be trusted to keep.
//   no lost block     — after quiesce a SEQUENTIAL replay of the same ladder
//                       must reach the driver zero times. Whatever served a
//                       size during the concurrent phase, its own class or a
//                       larger one it borrowed from, is free again now; a block
//                       dropped on the floor, or returned to the wrong class,
//                       is a miss here.
//   retention adds up — `retained_` is maintained by three different lines
//                       (`Get`'s exact hit, `Get`'s borrow, `Put`), each
//                       adjusting by a DIFFERENT class than the caller named.
//                       `Drain` recounts the free lists independently and must
//                       report the same bytes.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a #1922 gate. It is green with the borrow on, with

// only held in one lane would be a worse property, not a stronger test.
